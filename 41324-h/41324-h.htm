<h2>THE WHEREFORE OF MY LITTLE BOOK</h2>


<p>We have learned some things in war times
that we did not know in days of peace. We have
made the amazing discovery that our own fathers
and brothers and husbands and lovers are potential
heroes. We knew they were brave and strong
and eager to defend us if need be. We knew
that they went to work in the morning and returned
at night just so that we might live in comfort;
but we never dreamed that the day would
come when we would see them marching off to
war&mdash;a war that would take them far from their
own shores. We never dreamed that, like the
knights of old, they would ride away on a quest
as holy as that of the Crusaders.</p>

<p>As for army and navy life&mdash;it had always been
a sealed book to us, a realm into which one was
born, a heritage that passed from father to son.
We heard of life at the army post. We saw a
uniform now and then, but not until our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
men donned khaki and blue did we of the outside
world learn of the traditions of the army and of
the navy, which dated back to the days of our
nation's birth.</p>

<p>We did not know that each regiment had its
own glorious story of achievement&mdash;a story which
all raw recruits were eager to live up to&mdash;a story
of undaunted fighting in the very face of death
that won for it its sobriquet.</p>

<p>Because the army lay at our very door, we came
to know it better, to learn its proud lesson more
swiftly, but little by little the navy, through the
lips of our men, unlocked its traditions, tenderly
fostered, which had fired its new sons to go forth
and fight to the finish rather than yield an inch.</p>

<p>As a first lieutenant in the Girls' National
Honor Guard, I was appointed in May, 1917, for
active duty in hospital relief work. It was then
that I came to know Miss Mary duBose, Chief
Nurse of the United States Naval Hospital, whose
co-operation at every turn has helped this little
volume to come into being.</p>

<p>The boys of the navy are her children. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
watches over them with the brooding tenderness
of a mother. Praise of their achievements she
receives with flashing pride. With her entire
heart and soul she is wrapped up in her work.
Through her shines the spirit of the service&mdash;the
tireless devotion to duty.</p>

<p>I had never before been inside a naval hospital.
I had a vague idea that it would be a great
machine, rather overcrowded, to be sure, in war
times, but running on oiled hinges&mdash;completely
soulless.</p>

<p>I found instead a huge building, which, in spite
of its size, breathed a warm hominess. Its halls
and wards are spotless. Through the great windows
the sun pours in on the patients, as cheery
a lot of boys as you would care to see.</p>

<p>There are always great clusters of flowers in
the wards&mdash;bright spots of color&mdash;there are always
games spread out on the beds. There is
always the rise of young voices&mdash;laughter&mdash;calls.
And moving among the patients are the nurses&mdash;little
white-clad figures with the red cross above
their heart. Some of them appear frail and flower-like,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
some of them very young, but all impress one
with their quiet strength and efficiency.</p>

<p>I have spoken to a great many of them. They
are enthusiastic and eager. They praise highly
the splendid work done abroad by their sisters,
but they are serious about the work to be done
here as well. Their tasks are carried on with no
flaunting of banners, but they are in active service
just the same, nursing our boys to health every
hour of the day&mdash;giving sons back to their
mothers&mdash;husbands to their wives.</p>

<p>It is a corps to be proud of and a great volume
of credit should be laid at the feet of Mrs. Leneh
Higbee, the national head of the Naval Nurse
Corps. It was Mrs. Higbee who built up the
Corps&mdash;who has given her life's work to keeping
up the standard of that organization&mdash;of making
it a corps whose personnel and professional
standing in efficiency cannot be surpassed in the
world to-day.</p>

<p>As my visits to the hospital became more frequent,
I began, bit by bit, to gather a story here
and there, from the men who lay ill&mdash;stories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
unconscious heroism&mdash;deeds they had performed
as part of a day's work on the high seas.</p>

<p>They did not want praise for what they had
done. They are an independent lot&mdash;our sailors&mdash;proud
of their branch of service. "No drafted
men in the navy," they tell you with a straightening
of their shoulders.</p>

<p>And from the officers I learned of that deeper
love&mdash;that worship of the sea&mdash;of the vessel
placed in their hands to command. From them
I heard for the first time of the value of a discipline
iron-bound&mdash;rigid&mdash;a discipline that
brooks no argument. There were stories of men
who had hoped and dreamed all their lives of a
certain cruise, only to find themselves transferred
to the other end of the world. Did they utter a
word of complaint? Not they! "Orders are
orders"&mdash;that was enough for them!</p>

<p>And because those of us who send our men to
sea are burning to know the tales they have to
tell, I have made this little collection&mdash;the men's
own stories, told in the ward to other round-eyed
youths who gathered about the bed to hear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
full of eager questions, prompting when the story
moved too slowly.</p>

<p>What you read here are their stories&mdash;stories
of whole-souled youths, with the sparkle of life
in their eyes, with the love of adventure in their
hearts. Jack Tar is an American clear through
to his backbone!</p>

<h2>JACK TAR</h2>


<div class='poem'>
We're not long on recitation,<br />
We're just rough and ready gobs,<br />
But we rate ten gadgets higher<br />
Than some smug civilian snobs.<br />
When we're out on well-earned shore leave<br />
Drummin' up a little cheer,<br />
Oh, we meet sleek city dandies<br />
Who object to sailors here.<br />
They are togged in pretty shirts<br />
Like a lady on parade,<br />
And they wouldn't touch a sailor<br />
With a hoe or with a spade.<br />
We may not be ornamental<br />
In the tinselled dancing halls,<br />
When the nation needs defenders<br />
We are there when duty calls.<br />
Though we can't hob-nob with laggards<br />
Who sleep in sheltered bed<br />
And we can't enjoy peace pleasures,<br />
We can join the hero dead.<br />

<h2>SUNK BY SUBMARINE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Somewhere</span> along in January, 1915, I shipped
on the U. S. S. <i>Utah</i>. Always had a hankering
after the sea, and then, to tell the truth, civilian
jobs were pretty hard to land in 1915&mdash;you bet
they were!</p>

<p>Once you're in the Navy you stay for a while.
I liked it from the start. I got to know a thing
or two about the guns, went to gunnery school;
that's how I came to be made chief gunner's mate,
I guess, and told to report for armed guard duty
on May 29, 1917.</p>

<p>I drew an old tub. I suppose it had been used
to carry a cargo of salt fish from Maine to Newfoundland,
and here it was, painted fresh, and
ready to cross the old Atlantic, which was fairly
bristling with mines and lurking sea-devils.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>We put to sea June 19th, and we reached the
War Zone on July 3rd. I know what I'm doing,
writing War Zone with capitals. You don't have
to be told when you get there. You feel it in the
air&mdash;it's like a wire vibrating; everyone's on
edge, keyed up to G pitch.</p>

<p>It was my job to see that all lights were doused
and all ports closed as soon as it got dark. I
wasn't particular about the way I enforced orders
just so I got them obeyed&mdash;and I saw to it that
every man who carried a match was parted from
it and that all pocket lights were put in a neat
little pile&mdash;officers excepted, of course. They kept
theirs.</p>

<p>Every hour I made a round of the ship, watching
out sharp for a light. Important! Say, just
suppose Fritz's sea-baby were lying off a few
miles or so without the faintest idea that a merchantman,
chuck-full of munitions, was a stone's
throw away. Think how that German crew would
feel if across the darkness they saw the flare of a
match. Well, it would be apt to be lights out for
us all that time&mdash;that's what.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The watch was doubled&mdash;four on and four off&mdash;a
watch of good sixteen hours at a clip, with a
life preserver on every minute of the time&mdash;that
is, you were supposed to. On the transports the
rule is carried out to the letter. Catch a man
without a life belt and he can be pretty sure he'll
be up for court-martial when he gets back to port.</p>

<p>But with us it was different. We kept them
close by; some of the men slept in them. I had
mine over my feet ready to snatch up in case of
trouble.</p>

<p>It was July 3rd, remember, and we were feeling
pretty good. My bunky was McCaffrey&mdash;Mac for
short&mdash;a little red-headed, freckled Irishman from
Wisconsin, the best that comes west of the Mississippi.
We had it all fixed up to fire a gun off
on the Fourth.</p>

<p>"Sure, it's a fine opinion Fritz'll have of us if
he's thinkin' we're scared to let him know it's
our big day back home," he argued.</p>

<p>I thought it was a great idea&mdash;I told him I'd
stand by if he'd share the blame. Of course we
knew darned well we'd never really pull it off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
but it was good fun planning the whole thing just
the same.</p>

<p>The sea was calm that night, for a wonder&mdash;just
a gentle swell. We were on watch at eight, all on
good lookout. Orders were to stand by, and the
guns were primed, ready to shoot red hell into anything
short of an ally.</p>

<p>I wish we could have had a close-up of us.
Faces grim, tense from excitement, joking a bit
under our breaths, wishing to Moses we could have
a smoke, betting we'd get through without sighting
anything better than our own reflection in the
water.</p>

<p>Somehow we felt peppy. I guess it was thinking
about the Fourth and what it stood for.
Seemed queer to be in mid-ocean on the night before
the Declaration of Independence was signed&mdash;yep,
in the middle of a blooming black sea, with
nothing in sight but a dash of white foam against
your keel, where you cut along through a swell.</p>

<p>I'd just glanced at my radium watch and blessed
the girl who gave it to me. It was nine. I glanced
up. Not fifty yards away was a ribbon of white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
foam flung out on the water like a scarf, and,
sticking straight out, by God, was the periscope of
a German submarine.</p>

<p>No one waited for the command, "Fire when
ready.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>The ship was action electrified. I never saw
a crew work like that. They fired point-blank and
sent that periscope straight up to where all good
periscopes go. Ripped her clean off.</p>

<p>We weren't sure we'd sunk her, but we figured
we had. How did we feel? How do you think?
That was celebrating the Fourth right and
proper!</p>

<p>Mac, sweating like a horse, panting from excitement,
managed to breeze by and chuckle.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you we'd shoot one off to show
'em who's who?"</p>

<p>It was a great night. We were heroes. We
had knocked the stuffings out of a periscope; it
stood to reason we'd sunk her.</p>

<p>We figured out how it happened. The submarine,
when she was 'way out on the horizon line,
must have seen us coming. She had evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
made a long detour, plotting our course and planning
to arrive where she could take good aim and
fire. What happened was that we changed our
course, so that when she popped up she was
plumb across our bow. Surprised! Wow! I bet
her commander, if he's alive, hasn't closed his
mouth yet!</p>

<p>It was something like this:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/z026.jpg" width="500" height="191" alt="diagram" />
</div>

<p>Well, we pretty well patted ourselves on the
back, but German submarines must travel in pairs,
like rattlesnakes, or else she came back to life,
for an hour later she struck us amidships.</p>

<p>You know it when you're struck. Rather! The
crash&mdash;the roar&mdash;the tremendous vibration&mdash;for
a full minute, as the big hulk trembles and shudders&mdash;the
hiss of water rushing into the boilers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the steam gushing, the sudden listing, and, worst
of all, the throb of the engines silenced.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>You never forget that silence, felt rather than
heard. It means you're a goner for fair. Above
all the orders, rapped out like the clip of a hammer
on steel&mdash;that noisy silence sounds loudest in
your ears.</p>

<p>"Stand by your guns.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;." Sure we did.
While there was still a chance we wanted to get
a whack at that sub., but all the time I was worrying
about Mac. He was taking a watch off. Could
I reach him?</p>

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Get back, you damned fools.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Man the life-boats!"</p>

<p>".&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gee, that's a close one! Look spry or
you'll wash overboard.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>We didn't leave our post until the last life-boat
swung clear and landed with her crew. A couple
of boats had been smashed against the side of
the ship and we heard the yells of their crew&mdash;nasty
sound, that.</p>

<p>I forgot about my life-belt&mdash;I wanted to find
Mac. I couldn't. It was pitch black. The water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
was waist deep and washing over you in gigantic
waves. There was only one chance&mdash;to jump for
it. I took it. I landed near the propellers. I
could hear them churning fiercely&mdash;I could feel
their suction drawing me to them. I guess I
fought like a fiend. I'd heard about the death
men die drawn into that blasted hole the ship
makes when she goes down to Davy Jones.</p>

<p>I didn't think of home. I didn't think of my
past sins. I just thought with every ounce of my
strength that if I could keep swimming for a few
seconds more I could be clear of that undertow.
I made it.</p>

<p>All around me men were calling for help. I
made out a life-boat a few yards away and hollered
to them, and just then an oar floated by.</p>

<p>I never was so glad to see anything in my life.
I rested on it and caught another. Two oars!
Why, it was as good as a raft. I was safe&mdash;if
only I could find McCaffrey in that black hell.</p>

<p>I yelled his name and heard a sputter behind
me.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, save me&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't you swim?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Stay where you are; I'll get you."</p>

<p>It was Spick, one of the oilers&mdash;a big chap,
weighing a good one-ninety.</p>

<p>"Steady! I'm coming."</p>

<p>He grabbed the oar and lay across it, a dead
weight. Someone else pulled me down.</p>

<p>"Help!"</p>

<p>It was little Tucker, mess attendant, a kid of
seventeen. He was all in. I shoved them both
along, and they were heavy, let me tell you. Someone
in the boat saw us and drew alongside. They
lifted us in.</p>

<p>"Where's McCaffrey?" I asked them.</p>

<p>Just then I saw him. He was swimming
straight for us. I let out a yell, but it died in my
throat.</p>

<p>Straight out of the water, not twenty yards
away, rose the gray bulk of the submarine, its
greenish light casting a weird glow over that awful
scene of struggling men. Fritz's war-baby
had come back to gloat over the damage it had
done.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Our captain, with his pocket light, was flashing
the Morse code on the water as he floundered
about.</p>

<p>From the deck of the submarine the commander's
voice rang out. He spoke as good English as
I do.</p>

<p>"What ship have I hit?"</p>

<p>Someone told him.</p>

<p>"Where is your captain?"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>"<em>Where is your captain?</em>"</p>

<p>Then it was that little Tucker, sitting forward,
tense, leaned far out and yelled:</p>

<p>"Douse yer glim, Cap, douse yer glim.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>Out it went. The commander gave an order.
We couldn't hear it, but we were afraid he meant
to make straight for us and cut us in two. We
pulled away, but, instead, he was wishing us the
best of luck to lie there and rot, and then they
submerged&mdash;just vanished into the black water
from which they had appeared.</p>

<p>We waited trembling, but nothing happened.
There wasn't a boat in sight. The old hulk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
our ship had gone down forever. I thought of
the Captain and of McCaffrey.</p>

<p>"Let's get 'em now, mates," I urged. But from
the direction in which we'd last heard them there
came no sound. They weren't there. Nobody
was. So we pulled away.</p>

<p>It was a leaky boat and we stripped off our
shirts&mdash;anything we had on that was white, so that
in case Fritz came back he could not sight us. We
needed the shirts, all right, to stuff up the holes
in the boat. Those who weren't stopping up the
holes took turns bailing. We bailed like fiends&mdash;no
time to think&mdash;no time for anything but to
hope a convoy would pick us up.</p>

<p>Along toward dawn, at six-thirty to be exact,
our own convoy sighted us. The boys were
pretty stiff from exposure, but I was all right&mdash;all
right and fighting mad&mdash;my matey had gone
down.</p>

<p>"I'll <em>get</em> that Kaiser," I told them. And I will,
too. That's why I'm shipping on a destroyer next.
I'll get that Kaiser, see if I don't.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h2>WAR CLOUDS GATHER</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> French are a whole lot different from us&mdash;more
easy-going-like. They make their money
and spend it free. I like that about them. Not
like some people I know who won't let go of a
nickel once they gets a death grip on it.</p>

<p>Well, say, when we was anchored at Villefranche
we come to know a thing or two about the
Frenchies. Villefranche is just over the hill from
Nice&mdash;a nice jaunt of a couple of miles or so, or
if you've a mind to, you can take a little car that
gets you there before you know it.</p>

<p>Nice is on the style of Atlantic City. If you ask
me, I like Atlantic City better, but then that's because
they speak United States there. Still Nice
has a great bathing beach&mdash;you have to hand it
to them&mdash;and you get so you like them little tables
set out in front of the caf&eacute;s, where they "parlez-vous"
with each other and drink quarts of red
ink.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>We'd hike over to Nice every shore leave. Some
of the crew went as far as Monte Carlo, but not
me. I was satisfied. Besides, one place was as
sporty as the other, if that was what you wanted.
They was chuck-full of what the French call the
"joie de vie," which in Yankee means "plenty of
pep"&mdash;that's it.</p>

<p>You always felt happy there and the people
was great! Didn't seem to take nothing serious&mdash;the
Frenchies don't, in peace times. The
women had a twinkle in their eye and a kind of
sparkle about them, and the men said pretty
things and twirled their canes&mdash;oh, they was a
cheerful lot, all right.</p>

<p>Remember, all this was before the war. It was
August. Hot. Still. Can't you see it? The sea,
where our boat lay at anchor, calm as glass and
blue as a turquoise. The sand along the beach,
snow white.</p>

<p>It was a Saturday, and we had a forty-eight,
which took us ashore at ten in the morning.
Didn't want to miss no time on land. The day
was so fine that we decided to foot it into town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Everything was green and growing and smelled
good. We took our time and ambled into Nice
long about chow. The minute we hit that port I
knew for sure something was up.</p>

<p>Oh, don't think there hadn't been war talk flying
about. Sure there had, but, except for a general
uneasiness, you wouldn't know nothing was
doing. The Frenchies are like that&mdash;they don't
hunt trouble, but when it comes&mdash;oh, boy! They
sure are right <em>there!</em></p>

<p>We seen little groups of folks standing talking
together. The shop keepers had left their shops,
and joined the crowds on the street. They was
waving their hands&mdash;they are great on that&mdash;everyone
speaking at once. We come up close and
listened. What we heard certainly made our ears
ring!</p>

<p>War! France was going to declare war on Germany!
Queer how that black cloud seemed to
change the whole complexion of that little sun-soaked
town. I'd never seen the natives look like
that before. There was a little old woman who
kept a fruit stand&mdash;figs and peaches and what-not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
She always had a grin for us fellows when we
passed. She and her granddaughter. The granddaughter
was a pretty girl&mdash;her cheeks was as
red as the side of the peaches and she had black
eyes and hair. They was always ready to swap
a "bon jour" with us&mdash;but not today. The old
lady was minding the stand alone. She looked
kind of white&mdash;no smile&mdash;no wave of her hand.
She told me her granddaughter had gone to the
square where the bulletins was being posted. We
beat it over.</p>

<p>It was about three; no, I guess it was four,
before the big crowds began to gather in the
square. Up to that time there had been little
groups drifting here and there, but by four the
wagons had stopped at the corners, their drivers
had climbed down from the seats and pushed their
way into the mob, and the tram-car conductors
and motormen just left their cars wherever they
happened to shut off power, and shoved their way
in for a view of the bulletins.</p>

<p>I tell you, that little town was at fever heat!
Excitement! Say, nothing beats a Frenchie at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that! I've seen a lot of things in my time, but
it certainly gave me a queer feeling in the pit of
my stomach to realize just what those bulletins
meant. It kind of got you to see that little pleasure
city so dead serious all at once.</p>

<p>Everyone in Nice was in that crowd&mdash;rich man,
poor man, beggar man, thief. The ladies from
the Riviera, in their silks and satins&mdash;the tradespeople&mdash;the
poor&mdash;all fighting for a view of the
words flashed on the boards.</p>

<p>Someone yelled, "Vive la France! Vive la
France!" and a thousand voices caught it up until
it rose and swelled like the roar of the combers
in a storm.</p>

<p>We had seen Nice quiet and peaceful and
pretty&mdash;we saw a different Nice from that moment.
They didn't waste no time. They began
calling in the reserves. Do you know how they
done it? Why, they'd simply gather them up as
they went along the street. From buildings and
shops and hotels and huts they poured&mdash;boys for
the most part&mdash;some pulling on a coat and buttoning
it as they ran, and women following them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
always women&mdash;sweethearts and mothers&mdash;looking
puzzled and dazed by it all, but never holding
the boys back&mdash;not they!</p>

<p>I never seen fellows mustered in that quick.
The streets were choked with men&mdash;sharp orders
rang out, and the blare of trumpets and rolling
of drums. Say, I had to pinch myself to be sure
I wasn't dreaming it! You read about such
things, but you never expect to see them with your
own two eyes!</p>

<p>Some few men had uniforms or parts of uniforms.
Some carried old swords their fathers had
fought with before them. Some of them sang as
they marched to their barracks, arm in arm. Some
broke away and ran ahead, calling to a pal, stopping
to speak with an old friend. And always,
lined up on either side of the street, was the raving,
crazy mob that cheered them, flinging up their
hats and waving handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>Outside the caf&eacute;s, at the little tables, wine was
flowing like water. One glass after another flung
down with a toast to France. They didn't stop
at that. I seen a little girl spring up on a table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and hold her glass high; all the folks at nearby
tables jumped to their feet, cheering her. I
couldn't hear what she said, but suddenly she
straightened up and began singing the "Marseillaise."
Lord! The whole town caught up the
tune&mdash;it came from everywhere. Women in open
windows above the street, leaning way out over
the sills, sang it; children in the street piped up;
there wasn't no one too young or too old to
join in.</p>

<p>The boys marching by grinned at her as they
shouted it, and she waved to them.</p>

<p>At a crossing I caught sight of our little old
woman. She was shelling out all the fruit on her
stand to the boys as they passed. The tears was
rolling down her cheeks, but she smiled at them
just the same.</p>

<p>I didn't see her granddaughter until some time
later; then I found her with a fellow who was
dragging on his uniform coat and talking to her
at the same time. She helped him fasten it, her
eyes on his face. I never seen anyone look so hard
at a man&mdash;as if she could eat him up with her eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
When he left her she stood staring after him. I
wormed my way in through the crowd until I got
alongside of her and I took her arm, but she didn't
seem to know I was there.</p>

<p>Bulletins was flashed every few minutes. No
sooner would one get posted up than they would
tear it down to make room for another. Above
the roar of voices rang out the call to arms, and
always from no place in particular men and men
and men came pouring, keen to get into the Big
Scrap.</p>

<p>You couldn't take a train if you wanted to.
Everything was commandeered for the "military,"
as they call it over there.</p>

<p>The sun went down and the street lamps began
to wink at you and still the excitement raged. Bulletins&mdash;crowds&mdash;trumpets&mdash;voices&mdash;soldiers
arriving
from Monte Carlo and a new set of cheers for
them. No sleep for nobody, just moving through
the packed streets listening to a snatch of conversation
here and a snatch there.</p>

<p>And every passenger coach and freight train
jammed with soldiers on their way to the concentration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
camp. Those who had any, wore the old
French uniform&mdash;you know, the red pants and
blue coats&mdash;great colors, but say, what cruel targets
for Boche bullets they turned out to be!</p>

<p>Next day the cry went up for horses&mdash;they
needed horses, and they got them. That's the
Frenchies' spirit for you. Nothing is too much
to do for their beloved country. Every farmer
with a four-legged animal drove into Nice and
gave him up gladly, and what's more brought in
all his garden produce for the boys.</p>

<p>It was like a horse mart. I never seen so many
sweating, rearing, stamping brutes. One farmer
drove in a little blind mare he'd raised from a
colt. Rummiest horse I ever seen. Wind-broke,
with a coat that looked like the moths got into it.
The old man seemed pretty fond of her, for he
talked to her considerable before he parted from
her. He didn't pay no attention to the crowd
looking on, only he just kept whispering in her ear
and stroking her nose. After a while he turned
her over to the officer in charge.</p>

<p>"I have explained to my friend that she must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
fight for France and she has said in that case she
is willing to go," he told them in French. They
took her, too, and he hiked back a dozen miles or
so without another word.</p>

<p>Once on the ship again, we laid in the harbor
at Villefranche for a week, but from the deck you
could see the little seaport town and that line of
men that wound over the hill&mdash;tramping&mdash;tramping
toward the sunset&mdash;thousands of them&mdash;an
endless stream.</p>

<p>We went to Gibralter. Just to let you know how
particular them British ships had become let me
tell you that they halted us at sea one night and
made us run up our colors. They weren't taking
no chances.</p>

<p>We laid there another week&mdash;no liberty&mdash;nothing.
We knew then we was in the War Zone.
The gates were down and only the French and
English allowed in. You couldn't even coal your
ship, and what was more, we were in direct line
of fire from the British guns behind us. We
heaved a sigh as we started down to Tangiers,
Morocco.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Some contrast! No excitement&mdash;no faintest
hint of a war. Just a dirty Arab town with streets
so narrow your shoulders graze the walls on either
side. Dirt and flies and beggars.</p>

<p>We was burning up for news&mdash;we went crazy
tied up there a month. Then we went home and
learned what was happening. We heard about
Verdun and the Kaiser promising to make Paris
by Christmas and all such rot.</p>

<p>Folks asked us what we thought of the war. I
used to say, "If you want to know <em>my</em> opinion, I
think the sooner we lend those Frenchies a hand
the better!" and that's just what we're doing&mdash;at
last!</p>

<p>You get so you love them if you stay around
them awhile. They're so happy and cheerful, but
when there's business to be done you can't put
nothing over on them! I won't never forget that
old fellow and his blind mare. Gee! How he did
hate to part from her! But that didn't stop him
from doing it. But then that's Frenchies for you&mdash;nothing
is too much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a><br /><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE STUFF HEROES ARE MADE OF</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>HONOR MEDAL FOR U. S. SAILOR<br />
<br />
FIRST AWARD GOES TO OHIO MAN WHO SAVED<br />
BALLOON PILOT</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p><span class="smcap">Washington</span>, Nov. 12.&mdash;The first naval medal of honor
awarded during the present war was announced by
Secretary Daniels to-day as the reward of Dennis
O'Hara, who rescued the pilot of a kite balloon which
was struck by a squall in the submarine zone.</p>

<p>The balloon was being used for observation purposes
by a United States cruiser. The pilot was saved by
O'Hara from the submerged basket of the balloon.</p></div>


<p>When is a hero not a hero? Do you know, if
there is any one thing this war has proved to
all of us, it is the fact that every man jack of us
has a large and totally unsuspected slice of courage
tucked away within him somewhere. We
never used to think so. We used to suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the ability to be brave in the face of death was a
great gift granted only to a chosen few.</p>

<p>Do you remember wondering how such heroes
came to be born as the men of the "Light Brigade,"
who rode without a quiver straight into
the jaws of hell? We read in our history books
of Perry and Farragut, or we heard the veterans
of the battles of Lake Erie and Mobile Bay tell
the stirring tales. I used to suspect that these
men, whose names went ringing down the halls of
time, were of different stuff somehow&mdash;a sort of
super-caliber&mdash;I never thought to see the day
when the greatest deeds of fearlessness, of self-sacrifice,
would be performed on the field of
honor by the butchers and bakers and candlestick-makers
of this country.</p>

<p>Take a clerk who has toiled at his desk for ten
long years. He is afraid of death because he has
time to be, but close up his books and dry his pen
and let him join the army or navy&mdash;build him up&mdash;make
his white blood red and send him on a
destroyer or order him over the top&mdash;afraid of
death! not much he isn't!&mdash;too intent on launching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
a depth charge or sniping a Hun to think
about it.</p>

<p>Besides, once you get used to the idea that every
minute may be your last you don't seem to mind
it. You rather relax and you don't worry; you
obey orders and stand by&mdash;and you are determined
to be as game as the next fellow when the
Great Call comes.</p>

<p>Heroism is a large word for all this. It is just
a part of the day's work. That's what I like best
about the youngsters in this war who have done
deeds of bravery that can stand up beside any
acts performed in the days gone by. They are
indignant if you praise them. Yes, they are.
They tell you impatiently that what they have
done anyone else would do. Perhaps it is true.
I guess so. But you have to let it go at that.
They won't stand your making much of them.
Not by a long shot.</p>

<p>Take the case of the boy on our ship. He was
a capable chap, who went about his duties without
attracting a bit of attention. Just one of
those splendid cogs in the war machine&mdash;a Chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Petty Officer, who wasn't looking for glory or
honor medals, but was just doing his job to the
best of his ability.</p>

<p>Our trip over had been without thrills, unless
you work up one on your own by wondering how
it happens with the number of ships at sea minus
a light there are so very few collisions. That
always interested me. I remember one black
night when we were shipping seas over the fo'ca'sle
that were sending sprays to the bridge.
The darkness hung about us like a velvet curtain.
As far as we knew we were the one and
only bark afloat on the whole Atlantic, and yet
when dawn broke, we sighted a convoy going east.
If it hadn't been for pure Yankee luck she might
have been in the same latitude as we were. Had
the meeting come a few hours earlier or our
course been a trifle different the results might
never have been told.</p>

<p>But that is side-stepping my story, isn't it?
We had an observation balloon attached to our
ship, which we flew with considerable success during
the first part of the voyage. We were nearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the point where we expected to join the vessels
sent out from France to meet us, and as the
captain wanted the balloon to be aloft that morning,
she was sent up a good bit earlier than usual.</p>

<p>It was a squally, rainy morning&mdash;the sort you
expect in the North Atlantic. The sea was rough,
and I suppose we were making about thirteen
and a half knots. There was considerable wind
on our starboard bow.</p>

<p>In the balloon basket was a young officer. He
understood managing the big bag, so we sent him
up about a thousand feet. We passed through a
rain squall and the balloon rode that tip-top. He
telephoned to the officers below that he'd like to
stay up for a while as the wind seemed to be
dropping.</p>

<p>About a half-hour later we entered another
rain squall. It was a nipping cold one&mdash;far colder
than the first. The combination of chilled rain
and strong wind was too much for the balloon.
First thing we knew the bag had crumpled up like
a crushed-in derby. And, before you could say
"Jack Robinson," down she flashed like a shot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
her buoyancy gone, and the little basket suspended
about fifty feet below her, riding the crest
of the big waves like a tub.</p>

<p>Inside the basket, busy as the busiest bee that
ever came out of a hive, was that young officer,
throwing out ballast as fast as the good Lord
and his right arm would let him.</p>

<p>It had the desired effect. Up rose the balloon,
until it climbed to about five hundred feet, but
with its ballast gone it was like a kite without a
tail&mdash;a wild balloon at the mercy of the wind.
That was a sight you did not soon forget! All
hands were on deck staring up with bated breath&mdash;a
few tried to shout advice, but the gale
drowned out their voices and the boy in the basket
was far too busy hanging on for his life to
heed us.</p>

<p>The facts of the case were that he was virtually
a prisoner, with the ropes so twisted about
the basket, as it swung on high in its fantastic
dance of death, that he could not have saved himself
if he would. We didn't get onto that at first.
We rather expected to see him shoot like a projectile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
through the air. It certainly seemed to us
that he must be the one exception to the law of
gravitation, for by all rights he should have been
hurled earthward at least a hundred times by that
careening, dipping kite. And as it swung and
lunged and turned over on itself in wild contortions
it reminded me of a mad beast tugging frantically
at its leash to be free.</p>

<p>There was only one chance of saving him and
that chance was a small one against the almost
certain sacrifice of many lives. To stop the ship
was the one chance, but a ship with engines dead
in the war zone is a first-class target for the subs,
and I can tell you that any man with the responsibility
of hundreds of lives on his shoulders is
loathe to give the order. But the sight of that
pitching, rearing devil, with its fragile cargo&mdash;one
human life&mdash;was a sight no man could well resist,
and the captain finally gave the order to slow
down.</p>

<p>We went aft. The balloon hung over our port
quarter, and, as we drew it toward the ship, we
got hold of a trailing line from the nose of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
bag. The big kite came docilely enough, as
though it were tired of the game it had been playing
and was sorry for the damage it had done.
But the basket, with the man inside, was in the
water, half submerged and in great danger of going
down before help could possibly reach him.</p>

<p>Now here is where the hero part of the story
comes in. It was so quietly done that we did not
know, until we saw a man flash over the side of
the ship and down one of the basket lines, that a
rescue was being attempted.</p>

<p>The ship still had headway and the sea was
running high, neither of which argued well for
any chap trying to save a human being caught fast
in a maze of rope.</p>

<p>The basket was three-quarters submerged. The
boy inside was played out and could offer no help,
but the C. P. O., clinging fast to his bobbing goal,
went to work with his knife and a singleness
of purpose that no mere raging sea could
shake. He hacked away at the imprisoning ropes,
his teeth clenched, and at last crawled into the
basket and got a bowline under the officer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
shoulders. We hoisted him aboard, and while
we were doing it, the C. P. O. clambered up to the
rail, where eager hands drew him over.</p>

<p>But he did not want our praise. It embarrassed
him. What he wanted most of all was to
get into dry clothes and to go about his duties.
Hero! He grinned at the word. Just the same,
that is what he was&mdash;a real American boy with
steady nerves and quick eye and plenty of pluck.
Oh, yes, there are lots of heroes at large these
days, but they do hate like the very dickens to
have you call them that to their face.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a><br /><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>I've seen quite some service. You know about
that little party at Vera Cruz last year? I was
right there in the front row. I've always been
ready for a scrap provided they gave me destroyer
duty. Nothing else goes with me. Once you get
used to the feel of that rolling deck under your
feet you can't be happy on any other bark afloat!</p>

<p>There is nothing speedier or lighter on the
high seas. She will ride the waves like a bottle
that's corked up. Not following the trough of the
swell like a man o' war, but bobbing right over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the white caps or burying her nose deep in the
water as she cuts through.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And spray! Say! If it wasn't for the
shield around the fo'c'stle-gun, you'd swim to
Europe. As it is the combers sweep the deck in
rough weather like a young Niagara. High boots
help you some, but the only way to guarantee
keeping a good man aboard is to lash him to the
gun.</p>

<p>There is a temporary shelter for the gun crew
in the pilot house, but say, when the waves get too
sassy the gunners aren't ashamed to rig up a line
which they hold on to pretty tight let me tell you,
as they stand by.</p>

<p>Greatest sport in the world to have an ice-cold
spray breaking over your deck. Yes, and freezing
so hard you have to take a hatchet and chop
it. You never are entirely dry, and you're never
sure each minute won't be your last. But, say,
you wouldn't change places with a commander on
the biggest warship afloat!</p>

<p>Queer, how you come to love the bobbing little
devil. I guess it's human nature. The more cantankerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
a proposition is the more you like to
handle it. And salt water doesn't hurt you any.
Good for you. Don't they give you salt baths
and charge you a stiff price? Well, we get the
treatment free. Pretty soft, I call it.</p>

<p>We had a great crew. I was chief yeoman, with
a job of clerk, and in time of action I had to work
the range-finder. I was pretty busy, but I did
have time to ring in a few laughs at the ship's
pet. He was a Swede&mdash;Ole Hjalmar, and big!
Say, he was eight feet high&mdash;or, anyway, six-two,
with a voice like a bull. He was mostly ears,
and he had blond hair and high cheek bones. His
face was red from the high winds. It browns
mine, but it made him look like a ripe tomato.</p>

<p>He hated his pink cheeks. We used to guy him
about them, but most of all we made fun of the
big gold rings in his ears, and say, I don't think
there was a square inch of him that wasn't tattooed&mdash;stars
and pigs and anchors and eagles all
over him!</p>

<p>Education didn't bother him any. The only
writing he did in the twenty years' service was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
sign his name to his pay checks. But he was
always ready with a laugh. He was boatswain's
mate and his job was official scrubwoman and then
when an officer gave command he had to pass the
word.</p>

<p>I remember one day we were expecting to make
port that afternoon. It was wash-day and as we
changed our course it happened that the clothes
we had hung out in the sun to dry found themselves
in the shade. Our bags were still wet, so
Ole was told to pass the word to the men to shift
their clothes to the other side of the ship.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, sir," boomed Ole's big bass,&mdash;then
he gave the command.</p>

<p>"All you men who iss got clothes ver de sun
isn't iss, put 'em ver de sun iss iss.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>Say, that got us! and Ole never did hear the
end of "ver de sun iss iss." That was all right,
as it turned out, but next time&mdash;well, this is what
happened.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Boresighting&quot;&mdash;a 3-inch gun on board a merchant ship.</span>
</div>

<p>We anchored in an English port and like every
good "bloomin' bloody Yank," as our British
cousins call us, we got out our bats and balls ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to play United States baseball. We had four
cracking good teams on the ship. The first and
fourth would play, then the second and third.
The competition was pretty close and we were
tickled to death when the American Consul got a
tract of land for us and we went ashore to show
those Johnnies a regular game, after watching
cricket for an hour or two.</p>

<p>Well, after several days of games, some of the
men began abusing their shore privileges, and
the officers knocked it off and kept us aboard&mdash;no
liberty at all!</p>

<p>Gee, we certainly longed to get off the boat.
There was land only a hand's throw away&mdash;and
there was a whole diamond going to waste and
games tied. One afternoon, after talking the matter
over, we plucked up courage and drew lots. It
fell on me to go up to the Officer of the Deck and
ask for a Recreation Party.</p>

<p>I did.</p>

<p>He didn't waste any breath at all. "No," he
said, so I slunk back to my mates. But we didn't
let the matter rest. Every ten minutes another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
one of us would march up with the same request.
The O. D. got sore. Ole was on watch.</p>

<p>"Pass the word," the O. D. commanded
crisply, "<em>No Recreation Party whatsoever!</em>"</p>

<p>Ole did.</p>

<p>"<em>No Recreation Party what's er matter?</em>" he
hollered.</p>

<p>That finished him. He lost a rank on account
of it. Poor Ole, he got in dutch for fair!</p>

<p>We were convoying merchant and troop ships,
going out to meet them and bringing them back
to port. We started out one cold October day with
a raging gale blowing. The sea was like a seething
caldron&mdash;the waves were mountain high.
We had on all the warm things we owned, but, at
that, we were ice wherever the water struck us.</p>

<p>I was muffled to the eyes. Esquimos had nothing
on me and I could see we were in for some
stiff duty. It wasn't a matter of one day&mdash;it was
a matter of eight days on a raging sea&mdash;no
chance to take off your socks even&mdash;life-preservers
on every minute of the time&mdash;watching out
sharp for Fritz.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>A flock of us met the ships we were to bring in
and we started to steam back to our base, when
we had the shock of our lives!</p>

<p>It was early morning, barely light. The sky
was a gray line, as if you took a paint brush and
slapped a streak from east to west. The water
was gray and we men on the bridge rubbed our
eyes, for right in front of us, not five hundred
away&mdash;standing out black against the sky&mdash;was a
German submarine.</p>

<p>We figured she had laid there all night&mdash;and
was going to send our flagship to the bottom if
she could&mdash;but she couldn't have looked over her
shoulder, because she didn't seem to know we
were there.</p>

<p>Well, we were after her like a streak of greased
lightning. That was just what we had been praying
for; as we charged her we fired; we were
almost on top of her, trying to ram her, when she
submerged; we passed right over her as she
went down; you could see the bubbles and
spray.</p>

<p>Then we launched our depth charges&mdash;"ash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
cans," as we call them. They look like a ten-gallon
drum. You set them off when you are
traveling full speed right above your blooming
submarine&mdash;fifteen knots we were making.</p>

<p>Quick! Say, it's the speediest work in the
world, because, once your charges are dropped,
you have to beat it or get blown up yourself&mdash;as
it is you can feel the explosion for yards around.
Well, we dropped four&mdash;and got out of the way.
As for the sub .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. zowy! Up she came to the
surface, ripped wide open. Then she stood up on
her end and sank as if somebody had pulled her
down by the tail.</p>

<p>One man of the German crew floated out of her
before she sank for all time, and Ole, before we
could stop him, had lashed a rope around himself
and was overboard hauling him in. The
German was dead, so he couldn't give us any information.
Worse luck! But we didn't let that
make us feel blue. I tell you we were a pretty
pleased bunch. You feel good all over when you
get a German sub. They are so blamed much like
a crook waiting in a dark alley to stab a man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the back. Yon owe it to society to knock him out
good and proper.</p>

<p>Yep, great crew ours. Some say destroyer duty
takes nerve, but the reason I like it is that
you don't feel like sleeping on your job; you're
just too blamed afraid you'll miss the thrill of
your life if you do. It's a great life! Take it
from me!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a><br /><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>



<h2>HOSPITAL APPRENTICE DUDLEY<br />
SPEAKS:</h2>

<h2>IN TRAINING</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I didn't</span> know what I wanted to enlist in&mdash;I
didn't care. All I thought about was that war
was declared. That set my New England blood
boiling, I suppose, and I didn't waste any time.
I happened to be in Baltimore. I scooted down
to a recruiting station and joined the Navy.</p>

<p>They asked me what branch of service I wanted
to go in for. I said I didn't give a hang just
so long as I'd get a chance to go across and do a
thing or two to the Huns. They chose the Hospital
Corps for me. It sounded all right. I didn't
dream of the hard work I was letting myself in
for.</p>

<p>After I'd left the station I called up mother
on long distance. She was visiting in Connecticut.
I told her I had joined. She said she knew I
would and that she was glad I had not waited a
day. That's mother all over for you. I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
every ancestor she ever had fought in some war
or other. No slackers in this family!</p>

<p>It was April. I had on an unlined suit and a
light cravenette when three hundred of us left
Baltimore at eleven next day. We were going
to Newport. At five that afternoon we took the
Fall River line. It was pretty chilly then. I kept
wondering why the dickens I hadn't brought
along an overcoat&mdash;but you didn't speak about
being cold, although I'll bet three-fourths of the
men on that boat were chattering. We were in
the navy now&mdash;fine sailors we'd make if we complained
about a chill!</p>

<p>We arrived in Newport between four and five
in the morning, and anchored until daybreak. I
thought it would never come. The sky was grayish.
I hadn't slept all night and I was beginning
to wish we'd get somewhere where I could turn in
for a good rest,&mdash;but no such luck.</p>

<p>A petty officer met us at the steamer pier, taking
us over in a little government boat to Coaster
Island. We landed at the Government Pier and
there we lined up. There was a queer old tub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
anchored nearby. I asked someone what it was,
and he told me that I was gazing upon the old
frigate <i>Constellation</i>, which fought in the war of
1812 and is now used as a signal school. She certainly
looked out of date. I wondered if our
snappy sub chasers would look as clumsy as that
in another hundred years.</p>

<p>We marched to the receiving building and stood
around on the outside. I didn't know a soul there,
but three of us were Hospital Corps, and we sort
of stuck together. The rest were a mixture.
There were "sparks" that's what they call the
radio wireless men; and electricians; and there
were "chips"&mdash;that's carpenters&mdash;and there were
some of the "black gang," which are what the
firemen are called, unless it's "coalheavers." As
for us, we were the "iodine crew." It's a good
name, all right.</p>

<p>Each draft was called in in turn. A C.P.O.
would come to the door and bawl, "All right, all
New York draft in," and they'd waltz in while we
waited and wondered how soon before we could
sleep.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while they called Baltimore, and we
went inside, turned over our papers, and were
sent to an adjoining room to receive the Navy
hair-cut.</p>

<p>Say, talk about speed! Liberty motors have
got nothing on those four barbers. You no sooner
sat down than&mdash;snip-snip-snip&mdash;and&mdash;"Next!"
Then you signed your name, but what the barber
wanted with all our autographs I never have been
able to make out. Perhaps he figures some of us
may become great heroes and he'll sell the signatures
for a young fortune some day.</p>

<p>In the adjoining room we removed our clothes
so that they could be disinfected and sent home.
Then we took a shower. At times the water was
very warm, then suddenly it would get cold as
ice. They certainly believed in variety being
the spice of life.</p>

<p>We were vaccinated next, a long line of us.
And some were so scared they just curled up and
fainted. But I got through and went in for my
medical exam. If you don't pass it right there
you are rejected, but if you only have depressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
arches, or, say, stooping shoulders, they let you
through. They know navy life will fix that O. K.
Just do setting up exercises for a few months and
you'll gain a ton!</p>

<p>Then we were measured for our uniforms and
they were handed out to us: two suits of winter
underwear, two pair of woollen socks, a navy
sweater, a blue dress uniform and two white
undress uniforms, shoes, hairbrush, clothes,
"kiyi," which, in plain English, is a clothes brush,
shoe cleaning gear, needle and thread and thimble,
six pocket handkerchiefs, a neckerchief, a
pocket knife, two white hats, a watch cap and a flat
hat. Then you get your bedding: a mattress, two
pair of blankets, your hammock and your duffle-bag.
Believe me, the mattress looked good to me.
I could see myself drifting off into slumber in a
gently swaying hammock.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>They marched us to a Detention Barracks. You
are not supposed to leave there until you get permission,
in case someone breaks out with smallpox
or yellow fever.</p>

<p>Everything was complete in the barracks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Meals were cooked in a regular galley; there were
showers, mess room and sleeping rooms. Very
nifty!</p>

<p>A little, fat C.P.O. with a bald head came in
and instructed us how to clue our hammocks. It
didn't seem hard. We were pretty proud of the
job&mdash;all twenty of us.</p>

<p>By that time we could have eaten whale oil
with a relish, and a squad of four went for chow,
while the other fellows pitched in and laid out
the mess gear. That navy stew certainly smelled
good! The squad dished us out big portions of
it and that, with hot coffee, made us feel like new
men.</p>

<p>After we had finished four men washed up the
mess gear and the rest of us turned to and swept
down the room. The little C.P.O. bounced in
again and fixed up our watch for us&mdash;two fellows
on guard, each standing two hours. The
Chief posted the first watchman, and taps began
blowing as we started in stringing our hammocks.</p>

<p>It was great sport. Everyone had a theory
about it, but we were told that, whatever we did,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
we must get the hammocks straight, because a
sagging hammock is death on the back.</p>

<p>At nine, to the dot, lights were out. It was
pitch black in our room. Somewhere outside one
feeble standing light flickered, but inside, nothing
doing.</p>

<p>Remember, these hammocks are about seven
feet above ground&mdash;say, the fun started right
there. How to get up in them was some problem.
Each man thought of a way of doing it, and, in the
first rush, one or two made it, but the rest of us
only got a leg up and swung there before dropping
back to earth.</p>

<p>Everyone was hollering suggestions and trying
to get a grip on the blamed things. It wouldn't
have been so hard if the hammocks hadn't moved&mdash;but
they almost acted as though they had sense&mdash;hanged
if they didn't. They'd bob this way and
that, and the moment you got up&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>After three or four attempts I made it. I got
in all right, but, before I could settle down, over
it turned with me&mdash;spilling out everything I
owned, me included. I scrambled around picking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
up what I could in the dark, and what I
said wouldn't be passed by the Board of Censors.</p>

<p>I piled the things in again and crawled back&mdash;pretty
cautious this time. I rolled up my
clothes for a pillow and lay on my back, gripping
both sides of my little old bed. That's the
way I slept&mdash;or rather didn't sleep. All through
the night there were thump-thumps, as someone
fell out and hit the deck.</p>

<p>When I heard reveille next morning I was so
stiff I could scarcely move a muscle. I wasn't
the only one though. We looked at each other and
wondered if ever under the blue sky we would get
the hang of sleeping in something that turned
over every time you hitched a bit.</p>

<p>We cleaned up the quarters and spread our
blankets and mattresses to air. It was bitter cold.
We huddled close to the steam pipes and certainly
tackled the chow for all it was worth when it appeared
about six <span class='small'>A. M.</span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 422px;">
<img src="images/z093.jpg" width="422" height="600" alt="two men in blankets peering out of a tent flap" />
<span class="caption">A sniff of &quot;chow.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>After breakfast we lashed our hammocks, and I
told mine a thing or two as I tied it up. Then
we listened to the C.P.O. giving us our first talk
on regulations. We wondered if we'd ever remember
half the things he was telling us.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of sight, in trotted the
ship's tailor with a portable sewing machine.
Funny little man, so intent on his tiny task of
sewing little strips of white cloth inside our
clothes for marking. I suppose he felt as important
in his way as the Navigator.</p>

<p>Somebody passed out stencils with our names
on them, and the C.P.O., rather out of breath from
scooting all over the station, dropped in long
enough to tell us how to mark our clothes&mdash;then
he was off on the wing. Busiest man I ever saw.
I bet he lost ten pounds a morning. Well, he
could afford to.</p>

<p>We were dying for lunch. You are always
ready to eat in the navy, and the food is great.
Lots of it, too. A new bunch of men had arrived&mdash;we
felt like veterans as we gave them a hand
at cluing their hammocks&mdash;and say, advice! We
told them all there was to know about climbing into
your swinging bed.</p>

<p>That night, when I crawled in, I found I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a><br /><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
manage much better. I was dead to the world, and
I slept the sleep of the just. Nothing short of
reveille or an earthquake could have made me open
an eye.</p>

<p>Next morning we parted from our room-mates.
In peace times you are supposed to spend twenty-one
days in detention. This was war, so we had
spent three. We were to be shipped straight off
to our respective division stations.</p>

<p>We Hospital Corps men reported to the head
doctor and were assigned to classrooms. It
seemed queer to be going to class again, after
you'd been out making your living for a few
years in business, but we got used to it. The
lecture was on regulations, then they marched us
over to Barracks B, our new home. We three
from Baltimore stuck together. We were all assigned
to quarters on the second deck&mdash;it's really
the second floor, but you don't call them that in
the navy.</p>

<p>It was a big place, but with a hundred and
fifty men in it there was scarcely room to turn
around&mdash;packed like sardines. We found a tiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
space up by a window and put up our hammocks.
Supper was in the mess hall, then back we'd
go to school for a lecture; after that you
could study or write letters until nine o'clock
and taps.</p>

<p>We were up at five every morning, chow at six-thirty,
mustered at seven-fifteen, and marched
down to school in time to clean the lecture rooms
inside and outside. Spick and span is the watchword
of the navy. You get so you wonder how
you ever lived inside of a house that didn't shine
from top to bottom.</p>

<p>We didn't have to know much to pass exams&mdash;oh,
no! Only Anatomy and Physiology, and First
Aid, and Minor Surgery, and Operating Room
Technique, and Nursing, and Hospital Management,
and Pharmacy, and Materia Medica, and
Toxicologies, and Chemistry, and Litter Drill, besides
a little "lab" work in the compounding of
medicines. Oh, no&mdash;anyone could learn that with
one eye shut!</p>

<p>I stayed in Barracks B for three weeks, then the
government sent down some big circus tents holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
about one hundred and fifty, and we pitched
them. We slept on cots for a change. Queer how
we had to get used to them. Hanged if we didn't
long for our hammocks.</p>

<p>I remember one night when we had a bear of a
storm&mdash;a regular gale&mdash;and sure enough the old
tent began to leak. I happened to be on watch
so I spent about two hours going around keeping
a sharp lookout for leaks&mdash;there were plenty of
them. As wet a crowd of boys as I ever saw came
forth, and I sent them to the lecture rooms to
sleep. Funniest looking gang, sleepy and cross,
their blankets around their shoulders dripping
water. They made a run for the deck.</p>

<p>About twelve I woke my relief and started to
turn in. There was no leak over my bed and I
was half undressed when something rolled down
my back. I beat it for the school. Not ten minutes
later the whole tent collapsed, with thirty
men in it. Rescue parties were formed, and the
men inside needed it&mdash;a small Niagara had swept
in on top of them.</p>

<p>But no one seemed any the worse for it. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
were a hardened lot by that time. I thought of
the day I had left Baltimore and the way I had
shivered with the cold&mdash;here I was, only a few
weeks later, only half dressed, drenched to the
skin and not minding it a bit. The training had
done wonders for me.</p>

<p>Next day a pile of lumber arrived&mdash;we carried
it from the wharf to the Barracks and we were
informed that after school we would find nails&mdash;plenty
of them&mdash;one saw and one hammer for two
hundred men to lay the floor, upright and erect
tents before taps. Say, that was a staggerer!
But orders were orders and we fell to. What did
we do? Why, we got rocks or pipes or anything
you could use for a hammer and with two hundred
huskies working at top speed just to show
the C.O. that they can do a thing once they make
up their mind to it, we got those tents up that
night right as a top!</p>

<p>Luckily for me, my site was 'way up on Strawberry
Hill, back of the hospital, and with the
crackingest view of Narragansett Bay&mdash;and a
distant glimpse of the Atlantic. It was a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
life up there. We'd become so used to outdoors
that we used to talk about how strange it
would feel to live in four walls again. We took
everything as it came and enjoyed it. The government
certainly did all in its power to make
things comfortable. We used to wonder how the
Sam Hill all the busy people up in Washington
could keep every one of us in mind and see that
we were all supplied. It is a queer feeling&mdash;that
sensation that you don't have to worry about to-morrow
or what it will bring, that you are
clothed and fed and housed&mdash;and that your only
problems are the ones that may come with the
rising sun. Great life!</p>

<p>Other camps were all around us. The Yeoman's
camp, the Seamen's camp&mdash;nothing but
bluejackets from morning until night. We wondered
if the whole U. S. Navy were there&mdash;it
didn't seem as if there could be any more sailors
in the world.</p>

<p>The Hospital Corps didn't have much drilling
to do, just squad movements and litter drills and
counter-marching. We used to parade through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Newport to boom recruiting, and on Saturday the
whole school turned out for Captain's inspection
on the green in front of the War College.</p>

<p>There was so much to learn that we spent most
of our liberties in the study hall, but once in a
while we would drop in at the Army-Navy Y. M.,
or go down to beaches for a swim, or take in a
show.</p>

<p>At the end of three months we were through a
course that takes, as a rule, eight months. Then
I went to the Naval Hospital and there I made my
rate. Gee, but I'm glad I'm going over at last.
There's a girl down in Baltimore&mdash;I've promised
her some souvenirs. Some of the fellows have
been back and forth eight times without a glimpse
of a submarine&mdash;but I hope we see one. I'd like
to tell it what I think of it.</p>

<p>Yes, we're leaving pretty soon now. I'll tell
you all about it when I get back.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a><br /><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<h2>ZEPS AND TORPEDOES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I joined</span> the navy because I felt patriotic and
all the rest of it. You couldn't help it down home.
Everybody was doing it. My brother-in-law made
the yeomanry, my chum went in for hospital corps
work. Wherever you turned you found fellows
discussing their branch of service and swearing
it was the best in the pack. It didn't take me
long to make up my mind. I sure was crazy to
get "over there."</p>

<p>It's the English in me, I guess. Yes, I've got
quite a slice. Before the war I was thirty-third
in direct line for the title of Earl of Northumberland.
Now I am about seventeenth.</p>

<p>It's queer how much I wanted to go to London.
I just itched to. My family had come from Nova
Scotia to Louisiana and settled there. That's
where I was born&mdash;Johnny Rebs, you know. But
that's ancient history&mdash;just plain all-round American
now.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>I never had a chance to forget the English part
of me, though. I couldn't very well. You see the
solicitors send me a notice every now and then
telling me how good my chances are of inheriting
a thirty-three-million dollar estate and a couple of
dozen titles on the side.</p>

<p>Well, I don't care what I shipped on so long
as it had a prow and a stern and kept afloat. They
held me three months in the naval station waiting
for a ship, and at last I got one&mdash;and what a one!
An old oil tank! Ever see an oil collier? It resembles
one of the countries of Europe. Which
one? <em>Greece.</em></p>

<p>Grease everywhere. You eat grease and you
drink grease and you sleep grease and you breathe
grease. You never get it off your hands or your
clothes or your disposition until you land.</p>

<p>I was commissary. That meant I had charge
of the cook and bought supplies and dished out
food and made up the bill of fare. But I might
as well have saved myself the trouble of that,
because every little thing tasted alike. Why
wouldn't it, with eighty-three barrels of oil on
board?</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>None of us wore our uniforms. What was the
use? We were saving them for London or Paris,
and it's lucky we did! Instead, we slapped on our
overalls&mdash;"dungarees," we call them in the navy.
We looked like a crowd of rough-necks, instead of
a crew of snappy bluejackets.</p>

<p>We left some time in September, and steamed
up to Nova Scotia, then across. We had a speedy
ship, all right. Eight knots was the best she was
known to make. Say, did it give you the jumps!
It sure did! I could walk a heap faster than
that old tug could steam at full speed. It seemed
as though every raider and submarine in the Zone
would line up in a row and take a shot or two at us&mdash;it
was too easy to miss.</p>

<p>We had rough weather all the way. That and
grease are about all that happened until we hit
the Zone. There we met our convoy&mdash;a British
flagship, a number of merchantmen, and a flock
of torpedo-boats.</p>

<p>My pal was a fellow from Newark, New Jersey,
Bill Willsie. He was out for excitement.</p>

<p>"I certainly hope something will break before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
we land," he'd say, "so that I can have a real
yarn to spin for the folks back home."</p>

<p>He got his wish. It was the fourth day in the
Zone, at five twenty-seven in the afternoon. I was
on deck sniffing air that wasn't full of grease.
Suddenly I saw the red flag go up to the mast.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Danger!.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Gee, I sure did wish Bill</span><br />
hadn't wished for trouble out loud. I wondered
which one of us would get it&mdash;the British flagship
ahead of us, or the merchantmen behind.</p>

<p>It all happened in the fraction of a minute. I
saw scudding across the water the black nose of a
torpedo. You've heard of men having a premonition
of death, but how about seeing it coming
straight toward you at the rate of thirty miles an
hour!</p>

<p>My God! I'll never forget it! I thought my
heart had stopped beating. I gripped the railing
and waited. She struck the flagship and sank
her in seven and a half minutes. To this day I
can see her going down&mdash;the explosion&mdash;the roar&mdash;the
sudden list&mdash;the boats lowered, and, on the
bridge, two figures pacing&mdash;pacing&mdash;the captain
and the admiral.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Do you think they left their ship? Not they!
Up and down&mdash;up and down&mdash;those two paced.
Oh, I tell you the British are a great people, but
I wished to God, as I stood there, that I had never
had to see it proved to me that way.</p>

<p>Up and down they walked, talking together as
though nothing out of the way were happening.
I saw the ship settle for her last heave. No, they
didn't leave her bridge. Why not? They were
true British naval officers, that's the answer.
They sank with her.</p>

<p>By that time every alarm on our ship was
sounded&mdash;five long whistles, electric bells, a regular
bedlam let loose. I never heard such a noise.
The life-boats swung out ready to drop. All
hands were on deck except the engineers. They
stand by in the engine room until a ship is struck.
As soon as she is hit their job is to put out the
fires and turn off the water&mdash;that is, if they aren't
blown into the middle of next week first.</p>

<p>About eighty yards away the submarine came
up and fired point blank at us. She missed us
again and she submerged. That was the last we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
saw of her. The destroyers were working like
little flashes of lightning, picking up the men in
the water, darting here and there. You've seen
those dragon flies in the pools&mdash;that's what the
little gray fellows were, dragon flies&mdash;here, there,
everywhere. I never saw such quick work.</p>

<p>Along about eight we pulled into Dover. All
dark, except for a few smothered lights. We anchored
and went up on deck. We were pretty
glad to have land so near. You felt a lot safer.
The comfort didn't last long, for we heard the
queerest buzz in the sky above us&mdash;a long hum.</p>

<p>"Zeps! By Cracky!" yelled Bill in my ear.
"We're in for an air raid!"</p>

<p>Out of the blackness of the city before us leaped
a million lights, cutting the darkness like a knife,
hunting&mdash;hunting for those Zeps. Searchlights
turning their yellow blaze on the sky, whisking
from one point to another, relentless in their scour
of the heavens.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/z112.jpg" width="600" height="411" alt="group of men crouched around a machine-type gun" />
<span class="caption">The Colt gun is an important weapon for landing parties.</span>
</div>

<p>Now and then they would spot one of the great
black bugs that buzzed on high with that tormenting
hum keep it for a second in the radius of
light, losing it as suddenly, and all the while the
machine guns in the city pop-popped without
taking a breath.</p>

<p>Now and then from the sky would be hurled a
black something that flamed and thundered as it
struck earth.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Bombs!.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Their red glare
lighting up a roof&mdash;a cornice&mdash;a water front&mdash;showing
groups of frenzied little black figures
scurrying to shelter&mdash;then blackness once more
and the pop-popping of the machine guns, spiteful,
biting sound that never paused.</p>

<p>It lasted about half an hour. The Zeps circled
Dover and went back. The guns stopped firing
one by one, as though they had run down. The
lights died out, save for a few on guard. Did we
sleep well? We did not, in spite of the fact that
we hadn't had our clothes off a single night while
in the Zone.</p>

<p>"I bet we're going to have a swell time in London,"
Bill told me. "We sure have started off
right!" We certainly had!</p>

<p>We had three days shore leave and we started
out next day&mdash;sixteen of us&mdash;in our best bibs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a><br /><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
tuckers, to see the sights. Were we glad to get
ashore? Chorus&mdash;we were! We took a little
train&mdash;funniest train I ever saw. Reminded me
of the Jim Crow cars back home. They were
divided into first, second and third class, but over
there uniforms can ride wherever they choose,
and we are expected to pay only half of a third-class
fare.</p>

<p>Remember, we were one of the first shipload of
American sailors to put foot in London, and as
such we were one of the sights of the city.
Crowds! Say! New Year's Eve around Times
Square or Mardi Gras back home had nothing on
the mob we drew there in Charing Cross.</p>

<p>They fought to see us. They elbowed and
pushed and wormed their way in. The girls threw
their arms around us and kissed us, and the men
cheered, but that wasn't all. They wanted to
wish on the eagles on our sleeve&mdash;all of them did.
And they wanted souvenirs&mdash;anything for souvenirs&mdash;buttons
or American loose change.</p>

<p>"Give us American dimes," they'd cry. "Give
us American dimes," and they fought for them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
I had some Confederate money with me. They
snapped it up.</p>

<p>Two bobbies&mdash;they are the English policemen,
you know&mdash;came to our rescue, and packed us into
taxies, but not before the crowd surged around
us exclaiming about our caps&mdash;our little white
canvas hats. They had never seen any like them.
They wanted those, too. I don't know what would
have become of us if the police hadn't taken a
hand.</p>

<p>Say, by that time, we were hungry and thirsty,
but we didn't dare get out for fear of starting
another young mob. I felt like the President on
inauguration day, or the King, or someone.</p>

<p>"Stop at a beanery," yelled Bill to our driver,
a little old man with round shoulders and a shiny
coat. He cocked an eye at us.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir?" he said.</p>

<p>Bill replied, "As me Allies, the French, put it,
'Jay fame.'"</p>

<p>Our driver wasn't a French scholar. He looked
at me.</p>

<p>"Where is it you want to go, sir?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Food," I said. "In plain Anglo-Saxon, I
hunger&mdash;I crave nourishment."</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "I see, sir," and he dumped us
out before a restaurant. We went in.</p>

<p>"Ham and eggs," we all shouted. Every good
American sailor always orders that, but our
waiter didn't care.</p>

<p>"You can have either ham, sir, or eggs. Not
both."</p>

<p>And we learned something else, too. You
couldn't order more than thirty cents' worth of
food at one sitting. It's against the law, and,
what's more, you can't treat a pal; you can't even
treat a girl, which ought to please some people
I know back home.</p>

<p>We didn't stay in that joint. We tried four
others with the same result. I never wanted to
spend money so badly before in my life.</p>

<p>What got me was the work the women are doing
in London. Women bus drivers&mdash;women
street cleaners&mdash;women baggage smashers&mdash;and
all of them the healthiest lot of girls I've ever
seen&mdash;red cheeks and clear eyes and a smile for
us always.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you let us wish on you?" they'd cry.
Of course we let them. I only hope their wishes
came true.</p>

<p>But, say, night in London is one great party.
It gets dusk, and, if you're on to what you are in
for, you make a bee-line for where you are going,
before the light fades entirely&mdash;or you don't get
there. We didn't know that, so we planned to
go to the Hippodrome; but we waited until dark.
Say, talk about pitch black! It's pale beside London
at night!</p>

<p>Imagine Broadway with not a single light&mdash;not
even a pale glimmer. Imagine it filled with thousands
and thousands of people, bumping into each
other&mdash;talking, laughing, whispering.</p>

<p>No wagons or street-cars&mdash;nothing on wheels,
except an ambulance, which crawls about with
weird blue lights, very dim. Just crowds and
crowds, knocking your hat off, stepping on your
feet, taking your arm by mistake. Men apologizing.
Girls giggling. Voices coming from nowhere.
Forms brushing by and vanishing.</p>

<p>The streets are full. I think every last person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
in London must turn out after dark. It is one
big adventure. You never forget it. You don't
know where you are or where you are going&mdash;no
one seems to. When you get tired you stop someone
and ask the way to a rooming house. If they
know they lead you along. You feel a door. You
open it and close it cautiously behind yourself.
You are in a dark vestibule. You cross a black
hall groping before you. Suddenly your hand
touches two curtains drawn close. You part them.
Beyond is light at last. You enter the living-room
of the house. Someone quietly draws the curtains
so no faintest glimmer will penetrate the outer
darkness. Say, it was some experience!</p>

<p>Next day a gentleman in a big motor picked us
up, five of us, and showed us the sights. He
wouldn't tell us who he was, but he was a big bug
all right. All the bobbies came to a crack salute
as he passed by, and he took us through Parliament
and to Buckingham Palace. We couldn't find
out his name. All he confessed to was that he sat
in the House of Lords; so I asked him about the
family estate. He knew all the facts but said none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of the crowd were in London just then. I thought
of looking them up, but I didn't get a chance.</p>

<p>That night we took in the Hippodrome. It was
all right, but it made us homesick for the one on
Forty-fourth Street. When we got back to the
ship next day we found we were going home to
the U. S. A. That was the best news I ever heard.</p>

<p>We came back in sixteen days. Say, do I want
to go over again? Well, rather! And I'll take a
longer shore leave next time. Perhaps I'll run up
to Northumberland and look over the old place.
After all, seventeenth isn't so far down the line,
now is it?</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a><br /><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>



<h2>CAPTAIN BARCLAY OF THE MARINE<br />
CORPS SPEAKS:</h2>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a><br /><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>



<h2>"THE LEATHER NECKS"</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I don't</span> want to say anything that sounds like
boasting, but the Marine Corps is the finest branch
of service in the world. No exceptions. I guess
you know that marines date back to days of
ancient Greece. They had them then. They were
the landing party on shipboard&mdash;the fighting
force. They were right there with their bows and
arrows and javelins and spears, and they carried
out their contract as well as the men who rowed
the ship. Each one had his own particular duties.
It's the same today, but somehow the nation has
got into the habit of saying, "Leave it to the Marines"&mdash;and
we've tried to prove that we are
worthy of the trust.</p>

<p>In the old days there used to be a bit of feeling
between the sailor and the marine. You'll find the
reason for it in English history. About 1803 there
was a mutiny in the British navy, and the marines
helped put it down. After that they were called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
the Royal Marines, but the sailors got an idea that
they were on board a ship to prevent mutiny
and they did not like them any too well. But they
soon found that the marine had his own field&mdash;and
that he had just one motto&mdash;"There's nothing I
can't do."</p>

<p>It's funny the way our men tackle everything,
particularly as they have never been specialized
like other branches. For instance, there is no
bridge-building company, yet over and over again
when there has been need of bridges the marines
have just gone out and made them.</p>

<p>There's nothing you can think of that you won't
find some of them can do, from getting up a dance
to rounding up a bandit. I was in Santo Domingo
with my company. Most of the men were recruits,
pretty soft from life in the barracks. We were
ordered to a nearby post on the trail of a desperado.
Before us lay a march of about four or five
days. A hike is all right over level country
that is fairly dry, but ours lay through a series
of marshes winding upward over a mountain.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>We started off at a brisk pace and we didn't
let up. There were patches of land which sent us
through mud up to our knees&mdash;our feet were never
dry day or night&mdash;but there was no kick coming
about that. We were going to reach our base at
the time planned&mdash;no later.</p>

<p>The last day was the worst. We were on a level
stretch at last, but there was no shade, and the sun
beat down like a ball of fire. Our wet shoes dried
and cracked on our feet&mdash;and we were blistered
from heel to toe. But that didn't prevent our
making thirty miles that day or doing the last
four miles in forty-five minutes.</p>

<p>We were tired to death when we reached our
destination. It was ten o'clock at night. The men
dropped where they halted, just about all in. We
hadn't been there fifteen minutes when word came
to us of the bandit we were rounding up. It seems
he was in hiding in the hills about twenty miles
north of us. A woman brought us the tip. He
had thrown her down and she was taking her revenge
in the usual way.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking her earnestness. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was just one thing to do&mdash;go out after that rebel.
I sent over to the men and asked for seven volunteers.
When the boys heard what was wanted,
sixty per cent of the whole company offered
to go. They forgot they were tired, stiff, sore&mdash;you
couldn't hold them back!</p>

<p>I had the horses saddled and every one who
could commandeer an animal mounted one. Some
of them had never been on a horse's back before,
but that did not stop them. They were off like a
shot, the whole crowd of them&mdash;thundering up
that dark road in search of the outlaw.</p>

<p>They caught him, too, after an all-night ride,
and they brought him back with them. I tell you
a good rest was coming to them after that. They
certainly needed it!</p>

<p>The men have a great pride in our service.
They show it outwardly by keeping themselves
trim as a whistle. On shipboard each man is allowed
a bucket of water a day for his ablutions&mdash;no
more. Well, a marine makes that bucket go a
long way; with it he washes himself, brushes his
teeth, cleans his clothes, and scrubs the deck&mdash;anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
who claims he can do more than that with a
bucket of water will have to show me!</p>

<p>And a marine takes his job seriously, whatever
it is&mdash;yes, indeed. In the little French towns in
which they have been landed they have become the
traffic cops of the place. All the duties of a gendarme
have been assumed by them with neatness
and despatch.</p>

<p>The marines decided that no bluejacket was to
hold conversation with a French girl. Once that
was definitely passed upon they began enforcing
the law. A particularly happy young bluejacket
had received a flower from the hands of a little
French maiden. She had pinned it to his coat.
Along came the marine while Jack Tar was trying
to thank her in his very best and limited
French.</p>

<p>"Cut it out!" growled the marine.</p>

<p>"You beat it!" said the bluejacket.</p>

<p>In reply the marine quietly but quickly plucked
off the flower to emphasize his command. There
was nothing else to do but to fight, and the marine
managed to beat up Jack mildly. Jack went to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
ship's doctor to have a stitch or two taken in his
ear. He was still raging, and vowed he'd get that
marine as soon as he was out. The doctor stopped
stitching long enough to look up over his glasses.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't, if I were you," he said, "that marine
was very gentle with you. Next time he might
do some real damage."</p>

<p>Yes, the sailor respects the marine as a majesty
of the law. One slim, young marine is enough to
make a gay and irresponsible party of bluejackets
along the docks sit up and take notice.</p>

<p>There was a young sergeant by the name of
Watson. He was a particularly efficient chap.
Seats were hard to get on the train going up to
Paris, and, when a party of army, navy and marine
officers arrived at the little station, we found
that Watson had reserved seats for all of us. On
our return trip we were surprised to meet him at
a station some distance from the little town that
he was policing. We asked him if he, too, had
been up to Paris.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said. We asked him how it happened
he was so far away from his post.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/z129.jpg" width="600" height="415" alt="Men loading a large deck gun" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Stand by!&quot;&mdash;getting ready for Fritz.</span>
</div>

<p>"I went up on my own, sir," he told us calmly
enough. "I got to thinking that, perhaps, the bluejackets
were starting something in Paris, and I
thought I'd take a run up just to see they weren't
putting anything over on the marine corps."</p>

<p>Evidently he found everything O. K. or he
would have remained to adjust it.</p>

<p>It was Watson who had such trouble making the
French peasants clean up their huts. Now, as
everyone knows, the French peasant is an individual
who wishes to be left alone to tend his little
patch of ground. It is his own business if he has
the cow beneath the same roof that covers him, and
if the chickens have the freedom of the house it
is, after all, an affair between himself and his poultry,
so to speak. But not in Watson's eyes. He
had orders to clean up that town, and there were
no exceptions. Protests were in vain. He saw
that sanitary conditions for the first time prevailed,
and not until the houses fairly shone, and
the streets resembled Spotless Town, did he relax
and express himself.</p>

<p>"I see their point of view, of course, sir," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a><br /><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
told me, "but if it happens to be the wrong point
of view there's nothing to do but to right it."</p>

<p>The marines aren't beaten often at any sport,
but when they are they take it as a tragedy. A
ship's crew had been trained to shoot. They knew
they could shoot, and, on landing, they challenged
the marines to a contest. The marines, under a
grizzled old sergeant, long in the service, were immensely
proud of their skill on the range. They
accepted the challenge. They were dead sure of
the outcome. There wasn't a nickel within hailing
distance that wasn't wagered!</p>

<p>The marines got on the range before the bluejackets.
No advantage was taken. Well, the bluejackets
beat them at slow fire. They beat them
at rapid fire. They beat them on skirmish, which
the marines had boasted most about. Altogether,
it was an unhappy day for the marines.</p>

<p>Next day the commander of the ship, rising very
early, saw a sight which fascinated him beyond
words. On the range were the crack shots
of the Marine Corps. Glowering above them stood
the sergeant, his beard fairly bristling with anger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
his back ram-rod straight. He had the men all
out, and he was teaching them, with a thoroughness
incomparable, the rudiments of rifle practice.</p>

<p>With stony faces the men submitted to the insult
of being returned to the kindergarten of
shooting. Again and again they went through
the manual. It was a just punishment for permitting
bluejackets to defeat them!</p>

<p>"Join the Marines&mdash;and see the world"&mdash;and to
do that our boys pride themselves on extra quick
obedience to orders, for there is no telling when an
expedition will be pulled up in a hurry and sent
to the other end of the globe. But whether they
go or whether they stay, they accept it all calmly.
The words of the little marine, who was plying his
shovel one hot day, seem to sum up their contentment.
He had been shoveling dirt since early
morning. The sun was warm, and he paused in his
task to mop his face. He looked up with a grin.</p>

<p>"I enlisted to see the earth," he said; "and
here I am, digging it up, turning it over, and looking
at it!.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a><br /><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE WAY WITH THE FRENCHIES</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I'm</span> a home-loving man. I don't ask anything
better of life than my little house in the country,
with the wife bustling about and the kids waiting
for a game of ball or a tramp in the woods.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm a peace-lover, but I'm the kind of
peace-lover who wouldn't quit this war a minute
before the German empire is wiped off the map.
I'm going to stand by until that day comes to pass&mdash;as
come it will!</p>

<p>I'd like to tear the heart out of every German
for the work they have done to the French and
British and Scotch and Irish&mdash;oh, I know what
I'm talking about. Yes, you do, if you stay in
Havre long enough. You can get all your facts
first hand.</p>

<p>Just wander down to the station every other
evening when the big seven-thirty express thunders
in with her load of returned British prisoners.
Yes, you can see with your own two eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
what German methods are, and I tell you it makes
a man, who is a man, ready to give the last drop
of blood in him to stamp out a nation that treats
men that way&mdash;and what's worse&mdash;women and
children.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I'd been in the navy five years as a bugler.
You are on the bridge all the time, standing by
for duty. We were assigned to one of the prettiest
yachts afloat. It was originally the famous
pleasure boat of a great New York multi-millionaire.
She certainly was a nifty craft&mdash;about
three hundred feet long, almost as big as a destroyer,
and graceful as a swan in the water.</p>

<p>There must have been great parties aboard her
in the old days, and I wonder how she felt when
they knocked out her mahogany staterooms and
hauled down her real lace curtains and tore up
her fine saloons, for transport duty.</p>

<p>Nothing classy about her then&mdash;just dirt and
grease and the smell of pork and beans. As for
her color, she was gray, same as any little ten-cent
tug. But her lines didn't change. She was
like a fine lady who takes off her ball gown and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
puts on rags, and in spite of it you can tell she's
a fine lady through and through.</p>

<p>We carried the first American troops to land
in France. The very first. That was making
history, wasn't it? It seemed right and fit that
the proud little yacht should have the glory of
taking the first batch of Yankees to foreign
shores.</p>

<p>It was a rough trip, though, and we felt sorry
for the boys whose sea travels had been limited
to the ferryboat between Hoboken and New York.
Rough weather on shipboard is no joke. You can
talk about the hardships of the trenches, but how
about being aboard a pitching vessel, when you
can't even get a light in your galley ranges, which
means no food can be cooked and a steady diet of
hard tack and bully beef?</p>

<p>Oh, we hadn't any kick coming. It was all part
of the game, but we did wish the sea would calm
down a bit and the fog lift. I never saw such a
fog in all my days. From the minute we left, it
wrapped itself around us like a damp blanket.
You could hardly see your hand before your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
face. We didn't need a smoke curtain that trip&mdash;nature
provided one for us, all made to order.</p>

<p>Our first taste of excitement was on the thirteenth
day out. We were just wishing for something,
when we saw, through the mist that had
let up a little, a strange ship ahead of us. We
signalled her to make her colors, but instead she
started off as though she were trying to run away.
That promised hot excitement, so we went after
her. We chased her for five hours&mdash;now losing
her in the fog, now sighting her again, gaining
on her inch by inch. We were sure she was a
blamed German merchant vessel trying to sneak
back to her base, and we had the guns primed to
send her straight to the place all Germans come
from.</p>

<p>When we got within a few hundred yards of
her we hauled up the battle ensign on the foremast.
We meant business. The gunners stood
by. Just as they expected to hear the command,
"Fire when ready," up came the British Jack
to her mast!</p>

<p>Say, but we felt foolish, chasing one of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
own allies all over the broad Atlantic. We asked
her why the deuce she hadn't made her colors
before, and she signalled back that she
was under the impression we were an enemy
raider.</p>

<p>We calmed down after that and made port
without pursuing the rest of the British navy to
cover.</p>

<p>The base we established was the first naval
base in France. We kind of like to think that
some day, when our grandchildren cross the
Atlantic on a pleasure trip&mdash;it having been made
safe by us from those German vipers&mdash;they'll
hunt out the little harbor, tucked away in a corner,
where their grandfathers landed that June
day, and went ashore with the first handful of
American soldiers to set foot in France. They
were there for just one purpose&mdash;to show what
red, white and blue blood could do toward making
the world a safe place to live in.</p>

<p>No fogs in France&mdash;just yellow sunshine and
soft air and eager crowds waiting for us with
open arms. Flags everywhere. It certainly made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
you catch your breath to see your own star-spangled
banner flying from the windows of the
little French town.</p>

<p>We went ashore pretty flush. Some of us had
as much as a couple of hundred dollars, I suppose.
We made our way to the railroad station.
We wanted to get up to the "gay Paree" we'd
been hearing about all our lives. We couldn't
believe we were within hailing distance of it. It
had always been a bright red spot on the map
that we hoped to visit some day&mdash;and here we
were just a few hours away from the liveliest city
of Europe.</p>

<p>We made for the railroad station double quick.
It was there I had my first real taste of French
big-heartedness. In the crowd I noticed a beautifully
dressed woman. She had all the French
zip about her, but when she saw us she began to
cry, and she just let the tears roll down her
cheeks as though she didn't know she was doing
it.</p>

<p>She stepped forward as we were passing, and
the crowd let her through. They seemed to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
who she was, for they whispered together and
pointed her out. She hurried toward us and began
to talk in broken English.</p>

<p>"You must be careful," she begged us. "All
this money you have&mdash;it may tempt some of these
poor people. Put it away, I implore you. Use
only as much as you need.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>Then she caught my hands. "Oh, how glad I
am that you have come at last! How I bless you
and your country!"</p>

<p>She bought our tickets to Paris for us and
saw us safely on the train, putting us wise to
the ropes. Nothing was too much trouble for her
to do for us. I tell you we never forgot it. Even
after the train pulled out of the station we could
see her standing a little apart from the rest, waving
her lace handkerchief to us until we rounded
a curve and lost her from sight.</p>

<p>Now that we were started on our journey we
felt great and I began to tune up. I can sing a
little, my mates say, so I let out a few songs that
made us think of home. While I was giving them
"'Way Down upon the Suwanee River" the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of the compartment opened and a big chap in a
British uniform stood there grinning.</p>

<p>"Don't stop, boys," he said. "It sounds
bully!"</p>

<p>It was Paul Rainey, the great hunter. Say, we
certainly were glad to meet him, not only because
he spoke our language, but because we knew from
hearsay that he wasn't afraid of man or beast,
and that's the kind of a fellow you like to know.
He stayed with us the rest of the journey, and
as he was to be in Paris a day on his way to
Belgium, he took us with him to the American
Ambulance Quarters, where he was stationed.</p>

<p>We arrived there in the evening. Next day he
had to go on, so we found ourselves wandering
around the Place de la Concorde and the Place
Vend&ocirc;me and the Champs Elys&eacute;es without compass
or rudder.</p>

<p>It was a pretty city, but all of a sudden I felt
awfully blue. Everywhere you turned somebody
hollered something at you in a language you
couldn't make head or tail of&mdash;even the hack
drivers and little kids in the street talked French.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>I took a room at the Continental, and say, they
almost robbed the shirt off me. Next morning I
was wishing so hard for home you could almost
hear me coming down the street. I found the
American Express office and lingered there listening
to people speaking English. I wondered
where the gay part of "Paree" came in. It
looked busy and prosperous and warlike to me&mdash;but
gay? Nothing doing.</p>

<p>Just then someone spoke in my mother tongue
and I whirled to see a French army officer at my
elbow.</p>

<p>"If you have not already seen the sights of
Paris, it will give me great pleasure to show
them to you," he said.</p>

<p>I hadn't, so he proceeded to do the honors, and,
like everything the French do&mdash;be it big or small&mdash;he
made a thorough job of it. He was my host
for two days and a half, and I'll guarantee I saw
every little thing in Paris from the Apaches up.
I wouldn't have missed that sight-seeing trip for
all the gold in Europe. That's the French for
you. Their hearts and their homes were opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
wide to us. I bet there isn't a Yank living who
wouldn't fight to the last breath for them.</p>

<p>Next I fell in with two French privates on furlough.
They took me home with them and to show
my gratitude I sang our songs for them and
taught them some real live United States slang.
They were good pupils, too, and were proud as
peacocks of startling a crowd by calling out,
"Wash you step!"</p>

<p>It was from them that I bought my best little
souvenir&mdash;a German officer's helmet one of the
Frenchies had picked up after shooting his man.
It was a peach of a helmet, slashed across the
patent leather crown, and still stained with
blood. Inside was stamped the officer's name and
regiment. He was of the Death Head Huzzars&mdash;the
Kaiser's own.</p>

<p>I asked Frenchie if he didn't want to keep it,
but he shrugged. He could get plenty more, I
made out he meant. He was going back to the
front soon; they'd be picking helmets off the
trees once the French got really started. So I
bought it from him for forty francs.</p>

&quot;Topnotch Americans.&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Our boat lay in the harbor. They were coaling
it, and, once ready, we started our work of patrolling
the coast. It was on one early afternoon
that we got sudden orders to put to sea, and we
started out at a fast clip. Somebody passed the
word that we were on a rescue party and to keep
a sharp watch out for rafts or lifeboats.</p>

<p>Rescue party! Ever see men who have faced
death in a leaky boat all through a black night?
I'll never forget their faces&mdash;something was
stamped there that will never come out&mdash;a grim,
strained, white look you don't like to see. The
few boats we spotted bobbed about like corks on
the waves. The men were too numb to pull on
their oars. They had been rowing all night.
Some of them were half dressed.</p>

<p>Once we pulled them in and helped fit them out
with clothes we heard their story. They had been
struck amidships by a blasted torpedo along
about midnight. Their boat was a yacht something
like our own; the impact of the shell blew
her to a thousand bits. The men asleep were
killed like rats in a trap. The few on deck managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
to launch some boats and rafts before they
were sucked down with the vessel.</p>

<p>That midnight attack made our score against
the Hun a little higher, not that I needed any
incentive to hate him another notch. I had a
vision stamped on my mind I could never forget.
I could still see that black snake of a train crawling
into the crowded station at Havre&mdash;hear the
long-drawn grinding of the brakes and hissing of
steam&mdash;see the guards keeping back the mob
surging forward for a chance to welcome home
its sons. There was endless noise and confusion&mdash;but
occasionally you would find a silent watcher&mdash;a
woman and sometimes a man, who stood motionless,
staring at the cars&mdash;muscles taut, waiting
for God knows what horror.</p>

<p>Yes, you don't forget the first sight of the returned
prisoners, in their worn uniforms. White-faced
boys looking about eagerly for the face of
friends&mdash;friends at last, after three long years!
No, you never forget those battle-scarred men,
with here an arm gone, or a leg&mdash;or worse, the
eyes blinded forever.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, my God! you dream of it nights afterward;
you see that endless line of maimed and broken
men.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Hate Germans! I tell you I'm a peace-loving
man and all I want is my little home, with the
wife and the kids, but do you think I'd stop fighting
in this war while there is yet a drop of blood
left in me? Not much! I love my own too well
to let them suffer as those French and Belgian
women have&mdash;that's the answer!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a><br /><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<h2>A YANKEE STANDS BY</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I haven't</span> anything to tell about. Being torpedoed
is an old story now. Any number of men
have met Fritz on the way over, and, if they
haven't been quick enough, he's managed to take
a shot at them, but it isn't often we fail to get a
chance to return fire. Just let a periscope stick
its head out of water, and I'll show you action on
deck that would make a Kansas cyclone look tame&mdash;not
that I've seen one. My home is in the East.
The best we can boast about is a blizzard or two,
and a sixty-mile gale.</p>

<p>I enlisted as a signalman, and was assigned to
duty on a merchant ship. There were two other
U. S. N. signalmen aboard her, and we managed
to make the time fly talking about home and the
people we knew.</p>

<p>One of our prize ways of speeding up a long
evening on shipboard was to swap notes on the
summers we had spent. We all three, at different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
times, had "vacated" in the Maine woods, almost
at the identical spot, and, do you know, we hailed
the fact with something very close to triumph!</p>

<p>I guess we three hashed over every little incident
of our trips. We found we had had the same
close-mouthed Indian guide, that we had all fished
on the same bank of a little lost lake, that we had
all camped on the same site in a clearing by the
water. But when we discovered that we had used
the same sort of tackle, and the same-sized rifles,
we were almost "moved to tears," as the lady
novelists put it.</p>

<p>Those things, small as they seem, are the most
important things in the world when you are
far away from home. They certainly make
men inseparable, and, aside from the fact that
Dick Chamberlain and Tod Carlin and I were the
only Americans aboard, we became, from the first,
the best pals in the world.</p>

<p>We were proceeding as flagship of a convoy,
and, as such, we kept an extra sharp lookout for
trouble, once we were in the zone.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock on the afternoon of a clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
September day. The sea was smooth and we were
all on deck. The sky was so blue and the sun so
bright that it seemed as though the lurking submarine
we were always expecting was a myth like
the sea serpent you read about but never see.
Night time is the time you are looking for an attack,
but broad daylight always seems to dispel
thoughts of danger. However, the danger was
there.</p>

<p>We were struck close by the engine rooms. All
I remember clearly was the terrific roar and splintering
of wood, and the sudden listing of the ship.
The order rang out to clear the ship and the crew
immediately took to the life-boats in the event of
rapid settling.</p>

<p>We three found ourselves assigned to the same
life-boat. There was a slight delay in lowering it.
That delay was fatal. The explosion that we had
been expecting blew our boat to pieces and we
found ourselves struggling in the water.</p>

<p>The officers' boat had been lowered and it drew
up alongside of us. They helped us in. The captain
was all for going back to his ship. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
sure there was no immediate danger of her sinking.
The water-tight compartments fore and aft
were holding and he called for volunteers to go
aboard and help in an attempt to beach the ship.</p>

<p>By this time the other life-boats were beyond
hailing distance and we found out afterward that
the men in them, including some British gunners,
were picked up later by patrol boats.</p>

<p>Of course, all the occupants of the remaining
boats volunteered. I didn't particularly like the
looks of the ship, as her well docks were on the
sea level, but she had stopped settling and we followed
the rest aboard.</p>

<p>It seemed queer to be on her again. There were
just a handful of us, the rest of our mates were
out of sight, bound for none of us knew where. It
was like returning to a ghost ship, she lay so still
on the waters, rocking softly, the waves washing
over her deck.</p>

<p>There was plenty of work for all hands&mdash;it
didn't give us time to think. I was glad of that.
Dick and Tod and I joked a bit about what the
people back home would say now, if they could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
us up to our ankles in water on a sinking ship.
Afternoon changed to evening. Still we saw no
sign of help coming toward us. However, just so
long as Fritz stayed away we were satisfied.
When it got good and dark, though, we weren't
quite so pleased. It helps, I can tell you, to be able
to see your hand before your face. You feel a
lot happier then.</p>

<p>Late that night we made out something coming
toward us. We weren't sure whether it was friend
or foe. It gave us a bad few minutes, then we
made out the towboats who had come to our assistance.
We were so glad to see them that we
almost cheered out loud, which is one thing you
don't do in the Zone.</p>

<p>We passed them lines, and they steered a course
for land. All this time our ship was slowly working
water; you could tell it by measuring, but the
chief engineer continued to assure the captain that
we would be successful in beaching her.</p>

<p>All night we moved slowly through the water,
wondering each minute when she would take a
sudden dive to the bottom. Walking along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
edge of a canyon in the dark is much the same sensation,
I guess. We were glad when we saw a
pale streak in the sky, and watched the morning
star fade. Daybreak found us still afloat.</p>

<p>Some of the British crew had had experience on
torpedoed ships. I suppose they knew that the
wise thing to do was to leave her if they got the
chance. That was the reason why they chose to
go on the escort vessel when the captain put it up
to them. By morning it certainly looked as if our
ship would never be beached on this earth. We
were in water up to our knees. There wasn't a
dry spot on us, and the chill winds that swept
down from the north played a game of hide-and-seek
through our wet clothes.</p>

<p>The captain called us all together. He told us
that the chances for bringing her in were small,
that no man need stand by, that he did not blame
anyone for choosing dry land and dry clothes in
preference to almost certain sinking.</p>

<p>His speech did not shake the officers' determination
to remain aboard her&mdash;all of them. They
simply had no intention of getting off so long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
there was a glimmer of a chance of landing her
safe. Then the captain asked Dick if he desired
to remain or if he wanted to get off. Dick
grinned.</p>

<p>"I'll stay, sir," he said.</p>

<p>The captain asked Tod.</p>

<p>"I'll stay, too, sir," he answered.</p>

<p>The captain came to me. I had my answer
ready.</p>

<p>"I'll stay, sir," I told him.</p>

<p>After he had thanked us and gone on, Dick
called a meeting of the Three Yanks. "You didn't
stand by just because I volunteered to, did you?"
he asked anxiously. We shook our heads. Our
teeth were chattering so that it was hard to say
what we thought, so we didn't try. What I
thought was something to the effect that I wished
I had my extra sweater on underneath, and that I
was glad I had two such plucky pals.</p>

<p>We spent another night on board her. We had
had not slept for forty-eight hours, but we didn't
seem to need to&mdash;the excitement of wondering
what the next minute would bring banished sleep.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>The following morning at four o'clock we
landed safely on the beach. The destroyers
took us off the ship&mdash;all we knew was that at last
we were on something where we could rest. I
remember some of the crew asking us questions,
but I don't remember our answering. We just
dropped down on a roll of blankets and closed our
eyes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I woke last. Dick and Tod were chatting softly
in a corner. I opened my eyes and listened.</p>

<p>"Well, write it down, Tod, so you don't forget,"
Dick was saying. "You and Clink and I will hike
it for Maine. Is that straight?"</p>

<p>"What's this?" I asked. Dick grinned over at
me.</p>

<p>"We're making a little date for after the war,"
he said. "We figured what a lot we'd have to
talk about on that camping trip, eh?"</p>

<p>I nodded. "You can count me in," I said.</p>

<p>But, as it's turned out, there won't be any
camping trip for the three of us after all. Dick
was lost at sea on his next trip across, while I was
sick in hospital. Then I heard that Tod had gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
down, and it nearly knocked me out. There never
were two such pals as those chaps.</p>

<p>Perhaps some day when it's all over, and we've
licked the Hun to a standstill, I'll wander up there
myself with our stony-faced guide; and perhaps
I'll sit on the bank of our little lake and fish in the
clear water with the tackle we all used, or shoot
the same-sized rifle&mdash;and I'll have the satisfaction
of knowing that they've trod every inch of the
ground&mdash;it will be almost like having them there&mdash;but
not quite&mdash;pals like that don't happen more
than once in a lifetime&mdash;I wish I could tell you
just what great sort of fellows they were&mdash;oh,
well, I couldn't if I tried a thousand years&mdash;so
what's the use?</p>

<h2>A TASTE OF HELL</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I joined</span> the Navy as an apprentice seaman. I
thought it would be great to try a new way of
licking the Huns. I had sampled the army. Yes,
I was at the Somme with the Canucks. Greatest
bunch of fighters the world has ever seen!</p>

<p>I can say it, because I'm an American, but as
soon as war was declared, my three cousins and I
beat it for Canada and enlisted. We were all in
the same regiment, the third to go across.</p>

<p>You've no idea until you get into the thick of
a fight with shrapnel whistling past you and shells
bursting a few feet away, how much depends on
your leader. It's up to him to win or lose the
ground you're holding for all you're worth. The
men in charge of us were young and some of them
pretty green at the war game&mdash;but say! there
wasn't a bloody Hun alive that could scare them!
Not by a long sight!</p>

<p>We sailed in August, about two thousand of us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
We had a quiet trip across and, oh, Christmas!
how we did long to get into the scrap! They
landed us at a French port and we had just three
days' training before we were ordered up.</p>

<p>You can't make much headway in three days to
prepare you to meet the Boches, but we did manage
to get in a little drilling and skirmishing. All
the bayonet charging I learned was from a Jap in
my company. He was a funny little cuss. Why
he joined up I can't imagine. You'd think he
would rather save his skin and stay at home, but
he was all for fighting. He had been trained in
Japan and had joined the Canadians at the last
minute.</p>

<p>My cousins and I learned all we knew from him.
He seemed glad to show us. He was a friendly little
chap and some fighter! I remember seeing
him alongside of me for a few seconds in a trench
full of Germans .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and then not seeing him.
What became of him I never knew. You don't,
most of the time.</p>

<p>A long line of troop trains were awaiting us.
Pullmans? I guess not!&mdash;freights. We piled in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
We were all anxious to get to the front. We knew
they were in desperate need of men and that we
might get a chance to go over the top, green as
we were.</p>

<p>It was night before they opened the doors and
let us out. We seemed to be in a sort of meadow.
It was black as a cave, except for the lights of the
station. There was plenty of noise as two thousand
men alighted, but there was another sound&mdash;a
dull, thick booming .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cannons! It seemed
thousands of miles away, but you never forgot it
for an instant. It meant that we fellows who had
been so recently in offices plugging away for so
much a week were out there at last on the great
battlefield of France!</p>

<p>We had reached the trenches. They weren't at
all like I supposed they'd be. I expected them to
be narrow, with room enough for one man only.
Instead two and sometimes three could walk
abreast. It seemed to me as though we marched a
hundred miles that night. I was so tired I was
ready to drop, and then all the mud I had ever read
about seemed to be planted in that trench! Mud!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
We tramped through knee-deep slime&mdash;knee-deep,
mind you&mdash;and we thought that was bad until we
went in up to our waists.</p>

<p>It must have been raining pitchforks before we
arrived, and as we scuffed along the best way we
could it began again&mdash;a cold, driving rain straight
down from the black sky, stinging our faces and
running down our necks. After a while we halted
for the night.</p>

<p>There were dugouts where you could set up your
cook-stove if you were lucky enough to own one.
All your food you carried on your back in cans,
but you didn't have energy enough left to open
them. You just dropped down under the shelter
of a bunch of sandbags if you were lucky, or if
you weren't, in a muddy patch of ground where
you slept like a log.</p>

<p>Next day we were on our way&mdash;that long line of
drenched men tramping toward the sound of the
big guns. That's how you measured distance, by
increasing volume. The rain had begun in earnest
and it never let up for the three days we made our
way to the trench just back of the Big Hill.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed to be our destination, because we got
orders to begin digging, and we went to work with
pick and shovel. I forgot how tired I was in the
excitement of being so near the Huns. You do
out there. You don't worry about dying, that's
one sure bet, nor about eating or sleeping; the
one thing that gets you is when your best pals go
west.</p>

<p>I had to stand watch that night. That meant
two hours of pacing back and forth, fifteen feet,
ready for the enemy's charge at any second. I
couldn't believe that the fellows we were waiting
for were so close up&mdash;there across that short patch
of ground&mdash;but I realized it when a shell fell not
five feet away from me and blew three of my pals
to bits. By God! I knew it then!</p>

<p>I shall never forget it. I'd been listening to
them talk in a little knot as I paced by, swapping
smokes and trying to find a dry place to stand.
One of them laughed. That was the last sound I
heard before the crash of exploding shell. There
wasn't one of them left.</p>

<p>We were four days waiting for the signal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
charge. We were mad for it. It seemed as if the
leaders could not hold us back another day. We
wanted to get at those damned Huns who had
killed our pals. We knew we could lick them, raw
as we were. We had some full-blooded Indians
from Ontario with us. They were the real thing
in a fight. They did not know what fear meant.
There just wasn't any such word in the language
for them, and when they charged they forgot they
were supposed to use rifles. They threw them
away and drew their long knives&mdash;razor-sharp.
That's how they went after the Huns&mdash;and butchered
the swine good and proper.</p>

<p>On the fourth day the signal was passed along
the trench for a charge. One hundred and fifty
men were picked&mdash;every third man. I was lucky
and was one of the number. Every man was keen
to be first over the top. About nine of the Indians
came along. None of my cousins made it, but the
little Jap who had taught me bayoneting was beside
me, grinning and fondling his rifle as a mother
does her baby.</p>

<p>Our leaders sprang up on the sand bags and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
hurled us the order. How few of them came
back from that charge on which they set out so
fearlessly!</p>

<p>We climbed up. We heard our officers shouting
to us and our comrades wishing us the best
of luck, to give the Huns hell! We sprang forward
and the Germans opened a rain of bullets
from their machine guns full upon us and the men
who followed. They swept our lines. Men reeled
and fell to the left and right of me&mdash;just crumpled
up like those little toys whose springs have
snapped. Still we went on. We made the trench
and I speared my first Boche. Got him, too!
Brought back his iron cross as a trophy. The
Germans were scampering to the next trench like
rats caught in a trap. They sure do hate hand-to-hand
fighting!</p>

<p>We held that trench six days. It was jumpy
work. The Germans were driven back, but there
was no telling when they would start with the
hand-grenades. They didn't do that, but they did
something worse&mdash;gas. It was pretty new to us
then. We were fitted out with a sort of rubber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
mask that wasn't much good. We saw a fellow
drop a way down the line. Then one of the
brownish trench rats, a friendly little chap, who
ate the scraps I shelled out to him, turned up his
toes. We clapped on our masks, but the wind
was with Fritz and the gas swept through our
trench on the breeze.</p>

<p>It lasted about an hour and a half. I'd hate
the job of being the first man ordered to take off
his mask and test the air for the rest, but some
one has to, and it often means lights out for him.</p>

<p>I had been slightly wounded&mdash;a sabre cut on my
leg, but I managed to dress it myself. It was ten
times better to be up, however rocky you felt, than
lying around those damp trenches. I wondered
where my cousins were. I worried about them.
Somehow I wasn't afraid for myself, but I just
wished it would soon be over and I could get
home. You think about home an awful lot out
there.</p>

<p>We were sent to some swamps next. There
were cement trenches&mdash;German make&mdash;and they
were considerably drier. We were pretty comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
there except for an occasional shell
blowing things to bits. I used to wonder how
there was enough lead in the world to make all the
shells the armies used. We always had plenty of
ammunition. The Russians were the ones who
got the raw deal. We passed a lot of them on our
way out front. A regiment of them was holding
a square. They were dull-eyed boys&mdash;hopeless
looking. Do you blame them? One day they
would be sent out with ammunition to burn. The
next they wouldn't even be given a rifle. How
did they protect themselves? Oh, rocks and
stones, I suppose. But they were wiped out
when they tried to charge empty-handed, that's
sure.</p>

<p>The Germans raided us with hand grenades one
night. We heard them coming and we fought like
fiends, but they outnumbered us five to one. I
went down with a shot in my side. The next
thing I remembered was being aboard a transport
bound for home. Nothing ever sounded so
good to me as that word! I found my three
cousins were aboard. One of them had lost his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
two legs, another his leg and his arm, and the
youngest had his right arm blown off.</p>

<p>It didn't take me long to find out how lucky I
was. All I needed to do was to look around at the
other eighteen hundred wounded. They landed
us at Halifax, on our way to Toronto. I was laid
up for quite a while, and the funny thing was
now that I was home again I kept planning
ways to get back as soon as I could just to show
those Huns who's who.</p>

<p>I used to lie in my clean white bed, looking out
a long window onto the garden. It was calm and
quiet. But I didn't seem to see it&mdash;what I saw
were those blood-soaked trenches, with your pals
gasping out their lives alongside of you and your
leaders, falling even as they urged you to charge!
It took me a while to get well and when I did I
went back to the States. I had an idea. I would
join the Navy. It would be a new way of meeting
Fritz. I liked the thought of killing him wholesale
on the sea.</p>

<p>I enlisted as an apprenticed seaman,&mdash;that was
last March. I am in fine trim, except for a scar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
on my leg and a bullet hole in my side. I've finished
training now and I'm ready to be shipped
across. Gee, but I hope we'll get a fat submarine
full of German officers&mdash;and that we'll drown them
like the rats they are!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a><br /><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE WANDERLUST AND THE WAR</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I've</span> been torpedoed three times&mdash;three ships
gone down under me, and I'm still here. Didn't
mind it much&mdash;I can swim; besides, I'm pretty
used to the sea&mdash;first shipped when I was
thirteen. My father and mother had sent me to
a manual training school. I didn't like it. I was
always playing hookey and finally ran away.</p>

<p>I didn't care where I went just so long as it was
on a ship. I knew it was the sea I wanted. Before
I decided, I used to hang around the docks.
I liked the smell of the water and the big talk of
the old salts who had been around the world a
dozen times. They didn't stay cooped up in any
four walls studying geography&mdash;they went out and
lived it.</p>

<p>I knew enough about sailing to ship as boatswain.
I was big for my age, so they took me on.
It was a sand sucker going down to the mouth of
the Mississippi.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The skipper took a kind of a shine to me. He
saw I wanted to study navigation so he lent me
books and let me go into the chart house and
work. Arithmetic was hard for me, and spelling,
too, but I'd copy out words I didn't know and
take them to him. I guess he saw I was in
earnest.</p>

<p>As a result I got my rate as able-bodied seaman
when I was fifteen. I was in New Orleans then,
and I saw a chance to ship on one of the Standard
Oil boats bound for Tampico.</p>

<p>I was crazy to go to Mexico. There was a
"Mex" on the old ship and he was always talking
about the sunshine and free fruit in his country.
When I told him where I was bound for he
wanted to come, too, but my new skipper couldn't
see him. "Mex" drank too much fire water for
the good of one man.</p>

<p>We didn't stay long in Mexico. I got a chance
to go through Vera Cruz, and that was about all,
before starting for home. I'd saved quite a lot
of money and all the way back to New York I
kept asking myself would I or wouldn't I drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in on my father and mother to let them know I
was alive. I couldn't decide. When I got to
New York the first thing I did was to buy myself
a great outfit; then I started to the street where
I knew the family lived. On the way I met a
pal who was shipping on a small boat leaving
for Canada. He wanted me to go along. There
didn't seem to be any good reason to refuse, seeing
as I had all my papers. I'd never been to
Canada.</p>

<p>I told him about wanting to call on my parents,
but he said there'd be time enough when I got
back to port. I went along with him and up to
Nova Scotia.</p>

<p>All the time I told myself it was going to be
my last trip up the coast. I wanted to see Europe
next. When we came back to New York I went up
to Union Hall and told them I'd like to ship across.
I got my wish. They sent me on a Standard Oil
steamer bound for Rouen. At last I was going to
France!</p>

<p>I liked that country from the start. The first
sight I had of it was white houses and green fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and church steeples. I was so busy looking at the
scenery I couldn't do a stroke of work. I got liberty
to go up to Paris, and I saw all of it for two
francs. I just hopped into one of those little cabs
and said to the driver "Giddap," and he rode me
around. I didn't miss a thing.</p>

<p>We went back to Norfolk, where we were quarantined
for seven days because a yellow cook we
had broke out with the same color fever. That
gave me time to think, and I made up my mind
that I'd pay off and go up and see my folks. I
was sixteen then, hard as nails and pretty prosperous.</p>

<p>Once ashore I bought myself everything from
patent leather shoes to a derby hat. I wanted
them to see I'd made good.</p>

<p>I walked in on them at dinner time. My father
didn't know me, but my mother did. "It's
George!" she hollered, then stared at me. But
father didn't. He wanted to lick me for staying
away all those years. Mother wouldn't let him,
though. She wanted to hear all about where I'd
been. I was glad I could put some money in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the bank for her. I stayed home about two weeks
and then got so restless I knew I'd better leave
before they threw me out.</p>

<p>Well, I let myself in for an adventure that
time for I went to Halifax, and from there
shipped on an oil collier bound for Mexico. We
struck a hurricane and were washed ashore. That
was my first shipwreck. We had to eat stores out
of the ship's supplies, which were pretty low at
the time. I didn't like the looks of things and I
decided to foot it into Tampico, which we figured
wasn't more than forty-two miles south of us.</p>

<p>Eight of my mates and I figured that by traveling
toward the sun, we'd make it in a couple of
days. We packed our grub and put on the good
heavy Dutch sea boots we wore in heavy weather,
and set out through the woods.</p>

<p>Hot! Say, your head blistered under your cap.
We struck a swamp, but we were afraid to go
back&mdash;it was just as bad as going forward&mdash;so
we started through, but we miscalculated, for we
spent a whole day and night in there before we
got our bearings.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>We climbed the branches of the trees at nights
and slept as best we could in them. But two of
the fellows caught the jungle fever, and one of
them died before we could get him out. We buried
him there and marked the place.</p>

<p>Another man was pretty sick, and I remember
reading somewhere that sassafras root was
good for fever. We found some growing there,
and we managed to build a fire&mdash;but we didn't
have matches to light it, so we struck flints until
we got a blaze. We cooked the root and gave
him the juice. It saved him.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the swamp we saw a little
Mexican house. It was the greatest sight I ever
want to see. The woman was cooking some kind
of meat over her fire. We didn't stop to inquire
what it was so long as it was <em>f-o-o-d</em>. That was
enough for us. She was glad to give us all she
had, because American money goes big down
there. Several of the men stayed to look after
our sick mate, but I hot-footed it into Tampico
to find the consul and try to get back to the States.
I found him but he couldn't do anything for us.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>I didn't care much. It was a pleasant country,
so I decided to stay. I was there six months. At
last I grew tired of everlasting hot weather so I
asked a skipper on an English ship if he'd take
me back to the States. I told him I didn't care
about the pay, just so long as I got home. That
impressed him and he signed me up for a quarter
a month. He couldn't have paid me less, but what
difference did it make to me? Wasn't I getting
out of that all-fired hot country?</p>

<p>We docked at Baltimore. I was pretty seedy,
so I took the first job I could get, which was
night watchman on the docks. Then I wired my
mother that I was stranded without clothes or
money. She sent it double quick. I knew she
would.</p>

<p>Once I was outfitted I applied for a third mate's
job. I had already made my license, although I
was only seventeen. The hard thing was getting
any skipper to believe I knew all I claimed I
did. I found one at last. I told him to fire any
questions at me he could think of. He sure did.
He asked me things a chief has to know and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
came through. He took me on as third and I paid
off at New York.</p>

<p>When I reached there I went to the seamen's
Bethal, where I got clothes and the chance to ship
on an English vessel bound for the other side.
That was in 1915. The German subs had started
their little game of hide-and-seek, but we didn't
expect any trouble. However Fritz was waiting
for us. It was about six o'clock in the evening,
dark, with a full moon. I was on deck watching
the moonlight on the water. It's a sight I never
get tired of. All was quiet except the throbbing
of our own engines, when suddenly we felt the
blow that ripped her side open. A torpedo had
registered a hit.</p>

<p>We couldn't see the sub; she had gotten in the
moon's rays, and it was impossible to make her
out. We didn't try. The order, "abandon ship,"
had sounded, but I didn't make a lifeboat; instead
I dived off the side of the ship and swam around
in the water for a few minutes before somebody
heard me yelling and yanked me in.</p>

<p>Next morning an English schooner picked us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
up and we went ashore. Say, but I was mad
through to think of a blinking submarine sinking
a neutral. I never was neutral from that minute,
and when we got into the war I went in the
navy. I knew that would be the one place I'd
have a chance to take a shot at the Kaiser's pets.</p>

<p>We carried a big cargo over; our cargo line
was 'way down. We had a lot of green hands
aboard, "hay-shakers," I call them. Some of the
boys were pretty seasick. I bet they wished they
had never started across.</p>

<p>Well, we delivered our cargo and started back,
when sure enough, one dark night, we got it again.
This time, though, I was standing under the
bridge, and in the explosion a piece of rail was
hurled against me that broke both legs.</p>

<p>A big Swede, who had always a hand out to
help everybody, hoisted me into a lifeboat, but in
launching it was smashed up. I was in the water
and I certainly thought my last hour had come,
but I found the big Swede was swimming beside
me, and he dragged me onto a piece of board floating
by. I lay there until it was light and in answer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to our S. O. S., American destroyers came on and
picked up our boats. Was I glad to see the good
old American flag? <em>Was</em> I! I didn't know much
when they hauled me aboard&mdash;the pain was pretty
bad, but they sent me to a hospital over there, and
before long I was around again, fine as ever.
Takes more than a German sub to keep me
down.</p>

<p>I went back to the States in style on a transport.
As I always carried my Union book I had
no trouble in getting another new outfit, once I
reached my home port. I set out for France on
a cargo vessel. Well, say, it was clear sailing over.
We met our convoy and they hoisted up their signal
flag. We were all of two hours making it out.
At last we could read it, it spelled:</p>

<p>"What are you doing,&mdash;bringing Brooklyn
Bridge over with you?" They were making fun
of our queer-shaped bridge. Well, we started
back, but I know things always happened in threes
so I was pretty sure we'd get it going home. I
was right.</p>

<p>It was my watch, late in the afternoon. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
keeping a sharp lookout when I saw the torpedo
scudding toward us.</p>

<p>"Wake of a torpedo in starboard bow!" I
yelled. Say, that vessel wheeled like a streak&mdash;and
the torpedo missed. But the next one didn't.
Bing!&mdash;I felt the big ship quiver under me, and
the explosion that followed blew me so high that
I came down in the paint locker with my arm
under me.</p>

<p>You'd think I'd be used to torpedoing by this
time, and could keep my sea legs under fire, but
I didn't. I'm getting better though, and I'm
waiting to get a shot at Fritz that will send him
where he'll stay for a while. I certainly am glad
every time I hear we've sunk one of them, but I
always wish I was one of the crew of that lucky
ship.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a><br /><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>



<h2>CHIEF NURSE STEVENS<br />
SPEAKS:</h2>

<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a><br /><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>



<h2>UNDER THE RED CROSS BANNER</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> educated abroad. That's how I came to
love France and England almost as well as my
own country. I was in my teens when I returned
to America. I had always wanted to be a nurse.
Even while at school I longed for the days when I
should be old enough to begin training. It was my
calling, and, when I left school, I answered it.</p>

<p>I trained in France, England and America. I
had practised but a short while when I married.
My husband was a surgeon, and from him I
learned more of nursing than I could ever hoped
to have acquired from text-books. We were always
together. We played and worked and traveled
all over the world. When he died, it was like
a great light going out. I did not know where to
turn&mdash;I did not know what to do. Even to this
day I cannot get used to his being away from
me. It always seems as though he were on one of
his professional trips and would return.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>And then in 1914, just six months after his death,
war came, and I knew that my place was in France,
so I sailed at once and enlisted in the nursing
corps.</p>

<p>Those were the days before the great base hospitals
were established&mdash;the days when the dead
and wounded were left in piles awaiting such care
as could be given them by the handful of overworked
doctors and nurses.</p>

<p>It was there I found my "son." We had come
to a group of white-faced boys&mdash;the mark of death
on their brow. Lying a little apart from the others
was a young Frenchman. He had an ugly shrapnel
wound on his shoulder. He was unconscious
when we found him, but he was so appealing, so
young, that my heart went out to him. His clothes
were stained with dirt and blood, and the mud
was caked on his cheek, where he had fallen.</p>

<p>When we moved in, he opened his eyes.
"Maman," he said, and smiled at me. I think that
was what won me completely.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/z201.jpg" width="600" height="416" alt="men loading torpedo into lifeboat for recovery" />
<span class="caption"><span style="margin-right: 18em;"><span class='small'>Copyright by International Film Service</span></span><br />

Torpedoes cost money&mdash;they are often recovered and fired again.</span>
</div>

<p>I watched over his convalescence and learned
that his own mother was not living, so when he
was well once more and ready to return to duty, I
adopted him as my "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fils de guerre</i>," and to this
day I hear from him twice a month&mdash;and such letters!
Full of his battles and his play at the rest
billets&mdash;his dreams and his hopes. He is France
at her best, with the love of youth and life and
country in his heart.</p>

<p>There were sights on that battlefield you never
forget&mdash;never. It was the bodies of Frenchwomen
left dead by the Germans that haunt me&mdash;the
women they dragged from captured France and
took with them to their trenches. We used to
thank God when we came upon these girls that we
found them dead. At least these few were out of
their unfathomable depths of misery at last.</p>

<p>After ten months of nursing in France, the doctors
ordered a rest&mdash;no&mdash;commanded it, so I left
the service and went to England to visit an old
schoolmate, now married. Her husband was at
the front, but her father, a peer, whose name is
a great one in England, lived with her.</p>

<p>He had known me since childhood. He was very
fond of me. He was a man of great importance to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a><br /><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the government, but he had a delightful way of
dropping all the cares of State, once he reached
home, and of romping with his two tiny grandsons
whom he adored.</p>

<p>In their home I found the quiet I craved, and,
as I grew stronger, I longed to get back once more
to duty. I knew so well the desperate need for
trained workers. My friends sensed my growing
restlessness and Violet's father spoke of it at
dinner one evening.</p>

<p>"Why not join the British army?" he asked
me. "I'll try to get you a good post."</p>

<p>There were a number of guests present, and, as
Sir Arthur sat quite far from me, I did not catch
what he had said. But Violet had. She leaned
across and called to me.</p>

<p>"You aren't listening to father&mdash;he means
you." I turned toward him eagerly. "Why not
join the British ranks?" he repeated. "You say
you feel fit again and want to get out there. Well,
I'll give you a chance to prove it."</p>

<p>I didn't believe he half meant it, for his eyes
twinkled; but I caught at it.</p>

<p>"I cannot get to the front soon enough to please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
me," I cried. "Just try me and see," and no more
was said about it.</p>

<p>The days passed and the lovely English summer
changed into autumn. I felt splendidly. One day
I came in from a long walk. I glowed with health.
I just knew that I could not remain idle another
instant. I found Violet in the nursery with her
babies. I told her I must go. She laughed
at me.</p>

<p>"So long as you feel that way, it's fortunate this
letter came for you this morning, isn't it?" and
she laid in my hands a long, official-looking document,
bearing the royal coat-of-arms in one corner.
I tore it open. It was a command to appear
before the Matron-in-Chief of her Majesty's army.
I knew by the time that I had finished reading it
that Sir Arthur was responsible in a large measure.
He was well aware of the fact that no neutral
could serve in the Allied armies unless by
royal order. I flew to the office of the Matron-in-Chief.
My knees knocked together. Could I qualify
in her eyes for a post at the front?</p>

<p>What transpired seemed like a golden dream to
me. I was appointed Chief Nurse&mdash;or Matron, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
they call us Over There&mdash;of a hospital ship holding
four thousand beds! I did not show my inward
tremors. If it could be done, I was going to do it&mdash;I,
an American&mdash;and what was more I was going
to make those British nurses on my staff love
me in spite of themselves. I dared not think how
afraid I was to tackle it. I just kept saying, "I'll
do it! I've <em>got</em> to, so I can."</p>

<p>I returned to Violet and dropped in a heap on
a couch.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" she demanded&mdash;and I told
her. She listened, her eyes like stars.</p>

<p>"How splendid! You can do it if anyone in the
world can! You've proved your worth in France.
Oh, I am so happy that you are to look after our
poor boys!"</p>

<p>Sir Arthur came in at this moment. I knew by
his smile that he had been listening.</p>

<p>"Well, well, so you are to be a Matron, are
you?" he teased. I nodded. I was past speech.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you don't know that you will be gazetted
as Major in the British army as well. That
will probably be your official rank."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>And a major I became on my floating hospital.
I felt strangely alone at first. The only American
among so many English. For the first time in my
life I longed for my compatriots. Then one day
as we lay at anchor in the harbor, I saw, some distance
away, a battleship flying from her mast the
Stars and Stripes. I began to cry, I was so glad to
see my own flag again. I asked our wireless operator
if he would send her a message.</p>

<p>"Will you ask an American officer aboard the
Man-o'-War to come aboard the British Hospital
ship and speak with an American woman?" The
instrument snapped the message. The battleship
caught it, and, a few hours later, I saw an American
Naval officer for the first time in over a year.</p>

<p>I had never met him before, but I was so glad
to talk with him of our own land that I dreaded
the time when he must return to his ship. He went
at length, and I followed him with my binoculars.
It gave me a warm feeling around my heart to
have a Yankee ship so close by.</p>

<p>Once I started to work in earnest, I found that
my nurses were eager to co&ouml;perate with me in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
every way. Instead of resenting my authority
over them, they were anxious to help me, and the
fear I felt of my ability to handle this great task
was swallowed up by the mountains of work before
me. There was no time to fear or to rejoice.
There was no time for self, with four thousand
souls aboard who needed caring for each hour of
the day and night. For our ship was loaded with
the wounded from that desperate fighting in the
Dardanelles.</p>

<p>There were a great per cent who came to us
with hands and feet cruelly frozen, from the weeks
and even months in icy trenches. Then there were
shell-shock cases. One which appealed to us all
was of a chaplain, adored by his regiment.
Through the heaviest fire he had stood by his
flock with no thought for his own safety. An exploding
shell had brought on that strange state
of aphasia. He did what he was told to do docilely
and quietly, but he remembered nothing that
had gone before.</p>

<p>He was sent back to London, his mind still
clouded. I used to think of him often&mdash;his quiet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
studious face and soldierly bearing and his eyes
with their eternal question in them, which none
of us could answer for him.</p>

<p>Months later I saw him again. The government
was in need of a matron to take charge of a four-hundred-and-fifty-bed
ship bound for South Africa.
Fierce battles were raging in Mesopotamia.
I was selected for the task. I had eight nurses and
a hospital corps of fifty.</p>

<p>As I came aboard her, I saw a familiar figure
standing by the gang-plank. I caught my breath.
It was the chaplain himself. There he stood, smiling
quietly, with hands outstretched.</p>

<p>"I am going with you, Matron," he told me, "to
care for the boys."</p>

<p>He was well once more and back again in the
field.</p>

<p>Malaria was rampant in Africa. Our ship exceeded
capacity by over a hundred cases&mdash;men
with raging fevers. Working at top speed, we
could not bathe them all, and cold baths alone could
save them.</p>

<p>The convalescent officers helped us. We worked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
like machines. Some of the nurses caught the
tropical fever, too, but they stuck by their post.
They did not dare give in. There were too many
sick and dying men calling for them. I have known
those girls to stand on their feet when their own
temperatures ranged between 103 and 104 degrees.
They laughed at the idea of giving in. They
couldn't. That was all.</p>

<p>You have heard of the brutality of the Turk.
Let me tell you he is gentle compared to the
ferocity of the Germans. We lay at anchor near
Salonika. The Turks were on one side of the Gulf,
the British on the other. More than once I have
seen the Turks hoist a white flag to us, and, when
we have at length replied to it with our flag of
truce, they have sent an envoy aboard. Always,
he desired to parley with the Matron instead of
with the Commander, and I would be summoned to
receive his message.</p>

<p>"Mem Sahib," he would say, "we are about to
open fire on the British. You will move your ship
about fifty yards. You will then be out of danger."
He would bow and return to his regiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
giving us ample time to move before the great
guns roared once more.</p>

<p>But the Germans! To bomb a field hospital or
shell an ambulance, or sink a Red Cross ship is a
triumph for them!</p>

<p>It was three o'clock one morning. We lay in
the Mediterranean. An accident case needed instant
care. I ran to prepare the "theater," as we
call the operating room. The patient was treated
and had been lifted to a stretcher when the Huns'
torpedo struck us.</p>

<p>Then came the crash, the sudden trembling of
the ship and the sudden dreadful listing. We carried
the man to the deck, scrambling up as best we
could. The engine had not been struck, but the
stern was shattered. Every man who was able
to, reached the deck with life-belt on, and the
nurses and doctors flew to the rescue of those below.</p>

<p>We carried them all on deck, and the Commander
faced us quietly.</p>

<p>"The boats on the port side are smashed, and
those on starboard cannot be lowered."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>There was not a sound for a full moment after
he spoke, as the awful truth dawned upon us.
Then his voice rang out:</p>

<p>"There is only one chance&mdash;to jump for your
lives."</p>

<p>Jump for your lives! I looked at the men who
were too ill to be moved, who lay unconscious, with
flushed cheeks and closed eyes. Jump for our
lives! What chance had they? Truly the Boches
could take toll that night if they counted sick and
wounded men and Red Cross nurses as fair
prey.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The Commander shouted to us: "Jump feet
first. Watch out&mdash;jump <em>feet first</em>."</p>

<p>We had practised doing it in the tank on the
way over. With life-belts on, it is the only way of
preserving your balance.</p>

<p>The men were dragging out tables and tearing
up planks for rafts. They hurled them into the
water, and little groups of them climbed the rail,
stood poised an instant above the black depths below
them&mdash;then leaped down.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The voices of hundreds of struggling men rang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
in on our ears and we were helpless to aid them.</p>

<p>The Commander called the nurses to him.</p>

<p>"You go next," he told them. "The Matron and
I will jump last."</p>

<p>They were the bravest, coolest lot of girls I have
ever seen. They climbed the rail, hand in hand.
They hesitated a second&mdash;with a shudder at what
lay before them, then they leaped forward.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I could not look. Only the Commander and I remained.
He drew me to the rail.</p>

<p>"I can't do it," I cried, drawing back. But he
was very firm.</p>

<p>"Come," he said quietly, "it will soon be too
late."</p>

<p>He helped me up. My heart was thumping like
a trip-hammer in my breast. I could not&mdash;I could
not&mdash;<em>could not</em> jump. He drew me down suddenly.
I lost my footing and plunged after him. The
water closed over me. It seemed hours before I
came to the top. For a long time I could not move.
At length I began to swim. I knew enough to get
as far away as I could from the suction that would
draw me as the ship sank.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Three hours later patrols picked us up.</p>

<p>And yet, I love the water. If I am ashore and
cannot sleep, I pretend my room is a cabin and
that I am on a quietly rocking sea. That is why I
entered the Navy nurse corps of my country when
she declared war on Germany.</p>

<p>So I have served under three flags since war
was declared, and at last&mdash;at last I am under my
own!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>



<h2>GUNNER'S MATE M'QUIRE<br />
SPEAKS:</h2>


<hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a><br /><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>


<h2>"ABANDON SHIP!"</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Me</span> father was always talkin' about the old country.
Sure and he said there was nothin' in the
whole of America to compare with a corner of
County Cork! We kids used to poke fun at him,
but I'm confessin' it made us kinder hanker to see
that land ourselves.</p>

<p>He was after claimin' that the grass was
greener there than anywhere else on earth and the
sky bluer. As a kid I planned to run away and
ship over there just to see if the old man was
givin' it to us straight. But it was to Canada I
drifted, and, because I have more inches than most
men, the Northwest Mounted sent me an engraved
invitation askin' me to join them, which I did for
six years.</p>

<p>Sure, it's a great way to spend your days, ridin'
through snow and ice or mud and mosquitoes&mdash;accordin'
to the season&mdash;after the gang of outlaws
runnin' loose up there. But it was always worryin',<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the wife was, for fear I couldn't shoot quick
enough and they'd get the drop on me. She'd tell
me that it was the kid she was considerin'&mdash;she
wasn't wantin' to bring him up without a father.
She'd say he was too big a handful for her to
manage, then get around me by claimin' he was a
chip off the old block all right&mdash;all right.</p>

<p>So I give up me post in the Northwest and settled
down in Winnipeg. Then the war came and
I could see reasons all over the place for me
joinin' up at once. First of all, though me country
was America, me home was in Canada and I
knew that nine-tenths of the Canucks would be
friends of mine. Then secondly, wasn't I Irish,
which meant gettin' into any scrap that was goin',
so help me?</p>

<p>Well, the wife held me back at the start. She
kept coaxin' me to bide a bit. She argued the
States wasn't in trouble yet, so I listened with one
ear, but with the other I was hearin' from all sides
about the greatest free-for-all fight in the world's
history, and I knew that me, Patrick M'Quire, had
no business to be standin' by.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/z220.jpg" width="600" height="416" alt="three men in trench wearing gas masks" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Gas Masked,&quot; the men in the trenches throw hand grenades.</span>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The wife wasn't well and she was always
frettin' at the thought of me enlistin', so I told
her I'd wait, but I warned her that it was entirely
responsible she'd be if Germany tied the Allies in
a show-down. I told her I was a sharpshooter
with a record in the Northwest to be proud of. I
asked her why she was keepin' me back. Sure,
I demanded what business she had to be hamperin'
the Allies' chances like that!</p>

<p>Well, me humor fell on deaf ears and I
stayed until me own country, the United States
of America, declared war, and that same afternoon,
by the grace of God, I walked meself up,
bought tickets for the States, packed me family
aboard and two days later joined the navy.</p>

<p>It's compromisin' I was when I joined. I told
the wife that the fear of trenches or gas attacks
need never enter her heart, but I knew as well as
me own name the danger on the seas of Fritz gettin'
playful and stickin' a torpedo in your ribs&mdash;but
why worry her?</p>

<p>Better than me prayers I knew firearms. I
could take a rifle apart and put it together again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
with me eyes closed. I had had as many machine
guns jam on me as the next fellow. I was entirely
qualified to be a gunner's mate, which, I assure
you, I wasted no time becomin'.</p>

<p>They shipped me over on a British auxiliary&mdash;a
cargo ship. For the two months they held me at
the trainin' station. The wife had been knittin'
and knittin'! If I'd been bound straight for the
North Pole I couldn't be after havin' more helmets
or sweaters or socks or wristlets than she
sent me. Whist! how these women do slave for
us. It was askin' her not to, that I did at first,
until I saw it was givin' her the only mite of pleasure
she could squeeze out of me goin' away.
Women is like that. They wants to be babyin'
their men folks until the end of the story.</p>

<p>What I valued most of all was a picture she had
taken with the kid. That nearly finished me. I
was after winkin' and blinkin' over it like an old
fool parted from his senses. But she looked so
sweet smilin' at me there and the kid looked so
clean it almost broke me up.</p>

<p>I set sail on a warm June day. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
chance to go home and say good-bye. In a way
I was glad of that. She was, too. It's rough
weather we had all the way and plenty of work,
but I liked the life. I was hard as nails. I was
strong from bein' outdoors twenty-nine years of
me thirty. Weather didn't worry me&mdash;rain or
shine was all the same.</p>

<p>We came to the Zone. "Aha!" says I to meself,
"so this is the patch Fritz has picked to try his
luck with us as a target!" I kept wishin' for a
sight of him. Sure, I stayed awake nights worryin'
for fear the convoy sent out to meet us would
be so good it would scare all the subs away. It
was nearin' the point where we expected the sub
chasers to meet us that I got me wish.</p>

<p>It was about five in the afternoon with the sun
goin' down like a red balloon, when we sighted a
raft with a barrel propped up at one end. There
were two fellows aboard her, in a bad way from
the looks of them, stripped to their waists, wavin'
their shirts to us for help.</p>

<p>We had been after hearin' how dangerous it
was to stop your engine in the Zone and rescue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
survivors, but good God! who'd have the heart to
pass those poor fellows by! Perhaps they had
wives and kids at home same as us. We drew up
about five hundred yards from them and started
to lower the boat when the raft rose out of the
water and turned over and the men dived off.
Under it we saw the deck of a submarine, the barrel
still on her periscope.</p>

<p>It's trapped we were by her dirty trick! She
struck us amidships and then submerged. There
wasn't time to fire. We were sinkin' stern first.
The boats were swung down and I started to get
into me own when I remembered the wife's picture!
Sure, I had to have it! There wasn't no
two ways about it. I just wouldn't get off the ship
without it. Someone called to me to come on.
Someone pulled me arm. But I tore it loose.</p>

<p>"It's goin' back I am," I told him.</p>

<p>"You're crazy! She'll be down in four minutes."</p>

<p>"I tell you, it's goin' back I am.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</p>

<p>And he let me go. I guess he thought he'd done
his best to save a poor loon. All hands were on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
deck. I made for the hatchway and found it fillin'
with water. The furniture was floatin' around like
the little toys the kid puts in the bath tub.</p>

<p>I fought me way to me bunk. Over it I'd nailed
the picture. I felt with me hands until I found it.
I tore it off the wall and stuffed it in me shirt, then
I started out. The water was clean up to me waist
and pourin' in. The force of it sent the chairs and
tables crashin' against the wall. I dodged them
and found the stairs. They were submerged. It's
on me hands and knees I crawled, until I reached
the top. The water poured in on me.</p>

<p>I found the deck deserted. I looked down. A
few boats were bobbin' on the waves. I dived off.
When I came up it did me eyes good to see a boat
a few yards away. I swam toward it and they
pulled me in. A seaman named Doyle and another
called Hooper were good strokes. They rowed all
eighteen of us away out when the cruiser went
down.</p>

<p>About a hundred yards from us was a
boat full of our officers. It was decidin' to follow
them we were, when the submarine came to surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
again. She was after knowin' which boat
held officers, too&mdash;no doubt about that, because she
trained her machine gun on the lot of them without
wastin' time, and opened fire. Yes, by God!
shootin' on men adrift in a lifeboat!</p>

<p>That's a sample of Hun fightin' I won't forget
in a hurry! I'd have given me life and that of
all me dear ones just then for a chance to cut the
throats of those cool devils on her deck, pumpin'
death into that boat load of helpless youngsters.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>We expected to get it next and it's ready for
them we were. I hoped with all me heart and soul
that they'd come close enough to hear the names
I was callin' them. But they didn't honor us&mdash;not
them. They figured that we were all enlisted
men, not worth wastin' a shot on, for they submerged.</p>

<p>It was growin' dark, but there was still light
enough for us to take stock of our fodder. All
lifeboats are well equipped&mdash;provided with ten
gallon barrels of water, and with tins of bacon and
crackers. It's glad to find the food and water we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
were. The chances were pretty fair of our bein'
rescued in a day or two. That was good, seein'
we hadn't a compass and most of us was green.
We couldn't even pick the stars and none of us
knew seamanship.</p>

<p>We could do nothin' but wait until mornin' and
pray for the sight of a sail. Mornin' came. We
were stiff, 'part from wet clothes and 'part from
the hard boards on which we'd been lyin'.</p>

<p>There were four boys aboard&mdash;just kids, not
more than eighteen or nineteen. It's game they
were, all right. They were the life of that gang.
It's "Cheer up, they'll find us to-day," they'd tell
us.</p>

<p>One of them was bubblin' over with spirits. He
was a big, blond kid called Terry. He was one of
the gun's crew and I'd liked him from the start.
He appointed himself C. P. O. in charge of the
chow and dished out the crackers and bacon to us,
jokin' about our table de h&ocirc;te and sayin' he'd try
to do better next meal.</p>

<p>Some of the older men aboard shook their heads
over the way we was eatin'.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"Better hold back on the rations and water,"
they warned us. "We ain't rescued yet."</p>

<p>But we laughed them down. We felt sure some
ship must have caught our S. O. S. the night before.
It stood to reason help was hurryin' toward
us.</p>

<p>We took turns scannin' the horizon. It wasn't
hard, because the sky was cloudy. We didn't say
so, but it's hopin' we were that there wouldn't be
a squall. It wasn't long before the water grew
choppy and a mist came up. Some of the men were
glooms for fair.</p>

<p>"Fog risin'. We couldn't see a ship if she was
alongside of us," they growled.</p>

<p>The boys wouldn't be downed.</p>

<p>"We'll shout just to show them we're here,"
they said, and, at intervals all that long night,
their voices rang out, but no answer did we get.</p>

<p>Along toward mornin' it began to rain in earnest.
We caught the raindrops in our mouths.
We decided to start economizin' in water. It
cleared up the third day and the sun came out. It
burned our wet faces. Some of the men slept, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
most of us kept a lookout. Help must be comin'
soon. We didn't know in what direction land lay.
Sure, we'd pull toward the north, then hold a council
and decide it was the wrong way after all, so
we'd start off due east. But we didn't row as hard
as we had the first day&mdash;not by a long sight. Some
of the men were against goin' away too far from
the place where our ship went down.</p>

<p>"If we'd stayed around there we'd have been
picked up by now."</p>

<p>The men were gettin' sulky, blamin' each other.</p>

<p>"Sure, if you'd listened to me&mdash;&mdash;" we all
started off.</p>

<p>Only Terry didn't get sore. He and the other
three kids wouldn't give up hopin'.</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll find us by another day," he'd grin.
"What's bitin' you all?"</p>

<p>The fourth day dawned and slipped by. No
help. The fifth day came, and with it a storm that
tossed our boat from the crest of one big wave to
another. The water washed over us in torrents.
We bailed like madmen to keep afloat at all.</p>

<p>Sure, now, it's queer when you come to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of it, how hard men will work just to keep that
little spark of life inside of them. With no hope
in view they won't give up while there is strength
in them to go on with the fight.</p>

<p>We proved it through those days of black horror,
in an open boat on a sea full of salt water.
That was the awful fact that stared us in the face
as the days slid by&mdash;no gettin' away from it&mdash;a
certain knowledge that the water in those barrels
was gettin' lower and lower.</p>

<p>Six days&mdash;seven days&mdash;eight days.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Over a
week adrift, drenched to your skin all the time,
cold as ice at nights and hot as fire by day. Crackers
and bacon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. bacon and crackers .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
not enough of either to last much longer&mdash;and
then what?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>We didn't talk much. Even the kids, when they
weren't asleep in a sort of stupor, would stare out
at sea. Then on one mornin' we made out smoke
on the horizon! It was an hour of rejoicin'. We
were that wild with joy we stood up and yelled
until our voices cracked. We raised our wet shirts
on an oar and waved them, but it was no use.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
The smoke vanished, they had never seen us.</p>

<p>Some of the men sat down and cried like babies.
I wanted to, God knows, but it's responsible I felt
for those youngsters. Now supposin', I'd keep
tellin' meself, that one of them was me own kid.
Would I be after lettin' him see that I'd be givin'
up all hope? Not much I wouldn't, so I tried to
cheer them along.</p>

<p>Half a cup of water a day was each man's portion.
Half a cup, when you're burnin' up with
thirst and there's water all around you. Just what
you're longin' for and it's cool and wet and&mdash;salty.
We knew it would lead to madness to drink that
stuff, but we all wondered in our hearts how long
before we would have to.</p>

<p>We found if we sucked on buttons it helped a
little to keep our dry throats moist, but our
tongues were swollen and our lips were parched.</p>

<p>There was a Norwegian aboard. He had been
torpedoed before. He had great ideas as to what
we ought to do, but the trouble was he couldn't
speak English, and none of us knew Norwegian,
so we couldn't get him at all.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Nine days&mdash;ten days&mdash;eleven days .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
water in the barrels was down so low that I tried
reducin' me drink to a quarter of a cup a day. It
was then I got on to the fact that Terry was actin'
queer. The Norwegian put me wise. He pointed
to the ocean and patted his mouth, then he jerked
his thumb at Terry. I called the boy up sharp.</p>

<p>"Drinkin' salt water, eh?" I snapped.</p>

<p>He looked up. "What's that to you?" His
eyes looked hot and feverish, his cheeks were
flushed.</p>

<p>"You cut it out," I ordered. I almost choked
as I said it. What if it had been me own kid?</p>

<p>"All right," he growled.</p>

<p>But he didn't stop. At night he scooped up cupfuls
of it&mdash;he and the other youngsters, and one
mornin' we had four ravin', crazy boys on our
hands. They were stronger than we were and
when they tried to jump overboard we couldn't
stop them. We did our best to save them, but they
fought us with the strength of fiends. We couldn't
get them back into the boat&mdash;we lost all four of
them. After that I don't remember much.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>For two weeks the water held out, but we were
afloat four days longer. We were semi-conscious
by that time&mdash;nothin' troubled us.</p>

<p>An English fishin' smack picked us up and took
us to a lighthouse off the Irish coast. When I
came to I found meself bein' fed water a spoonful
at a time. Sure, I couldn't take more if I wanted
to, me tongue was that thick. I stayed there three
weeks, when they sent me to Ireland and I lay in
hospital there for a month. From the windows I
could see the treetops and a glimpse of the
heavens, but do you know it seemed to me that the
sky in America was a heap bluer and the leaves a
world greener and, oh, how I wished for a sight
of the wife and the kid!</p>

<h2>PRISONERS OF WAR</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I want</span> to be a doctor, that's why when the war
came I turned to the Hospital Corps. I had heard
of the advantages you derive from the instruction
and the experience you get in that branch of service,
and, besides, I liked the crowd of men going
in for it. One high school had its whole football
team in the corps. I figured if it was good enough
for a star quarter-back it was good enough for
yours truly.</p>

<p>I went in as an apprentice, of course, but I soon
got onto the fact that I needn't stay one for the
rest of my life if I really wanted to get ahead.
Naturally it meant work and lots of it, but why
stay in the "pick-and-shovel" class if you don't
have to?</p>

<p>You see, advancement entailed certain responsibility.
To be a pharmacist's mate third class,
you are supposed to be of immediate value to the
medical officer in the sick bay of a ship. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a><br /><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
you are a pharmacist's mate second class, you are
supposed to take charge of a Hospital Corps man's
work on board ship, and in case the medical officer
is away for the time being. But to be a pharmacist
mate first class, it may be up to you to take
charge of the medical department of a ship to
which no medical officer is attached.</p>

<p>I went to it. I don't suppose I ever worked so
hard in my entire life. But I didn't see the use
of being in a corps and staying down in the coal
hole when there was plenty of room on top.</p>

<p>Our duties could be summed up briefly: we
nursed the sick, and administered first aid to accident
cases. Some of us were to accompany expeditionary
forces to the front and give first aid to
the wounded, beside assisting at surgical operations.
That was about all we had to do, except to
look after the medical stores and property, and
know all there was to know about compounding
medicine.</p>

<p>But one of the things I liked best about it was
a certain fact that was brought out strongly&mdash;we
were in the service to save lives. Get that into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
your head! It was drummed into ours. We began
to think we were privileged people because, while
we were in the war, it just happened to be our job
to save life instead of taking it.</p>

<p>I don't mean by that that we wouldn't relish a
chance to get a crack at Fritz, the killer of women
and babes, but our official task happened to be
helping poor chaps back who had been laid low by
a piece of Hun steel.</p>

<p>Once I had got my rating, I was told to report
for duty on a destroyer. That just about suited
me. I had been scared to death that they'd hold
me at a base hospital, with no chance to cross the
briny deep, and I went in search of my chum to
say good-bye.</p>

<p>He was a quiet sort of chap, with a pair of horn-rimmed
glasses that won for him the name of
"Specs." He was as funny off duty as a goat, but
the best corps man I have ever seen on his job.
We were always together. We had plugged
through the course together, and worried about
the exams together, and we had hoped that fate
would be kind to us and send us across on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
ship. But nothing doing. I parted from him with
all kinds of promises to write and went aboard the
destroyer.</p>

<p>The first man I saw on deck was "Specs," double
glasses and all. I couldn't believe my eyes. I
stared at him like a fool. And by cracky, it turned
out to be his brother, who was coxswain and
enough like "Specs" to pass for himself. Well,
needless to say, Trace and I hit it up from the
word go.</p>

<p>We had a few accident cases which kept me
fairly busy going over, but as we came nearer the
Zone I got the fever that runs in every man's blood
to catch a sight of Fritz. There were some fellows
aboard who had crossed a half-dozen times without
a squint at a submarine and with nothing
fiercer to take a shot at than a sleepy whale.</p>

<p>We were escorting a merchant ship flotilla&mdash;a
whole flock of us. It had been an exciting day all
right! Early that morning, while it was yet dark,
we had made out what seemed to us to be a ring of
little lights upon the water. Take it from me, we
don't rush in on anything like that. It may be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
German's coy trap for blowing you sky high. But
we sure were curious and we circled the lights
swiftly, by no means certain but that every minute
would be our last. As we approached them we
made them out. They were lifeboats full of men
signaling wildly for help.</p>

<p>We flew to their rescue and picked them up.
The lot of them were half frozen and barely able
to tell us the old story of Fritz's stab in the dark.
I had some work to do then! There were frostbitten
hands and feet and ears to care for, and
chills and fever to ward off. I worked over them
for hours. We found out that they were the crew
of a British cargo ship and as soon as it was
light we landed them at a nearby port and set out
to sea again.</p>

<p>It was a wild morning. The wind had risen to
what was fast becoming a gale. Think of a gale
at sea in November! Icy waves sweep your deck
and toss your ship about like a ball in the
water. No chance to cook a mouthful, as nothing
would stay on the range long enough&mdash;hardtack
for all hands and lucky to get it&mdash;stand by as
best you can in case of a lurking Fritz.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The gale grew worse. I had never seen such an
ugly storm. The sky was almost black and the sea
was running so high that it seemed as though
green mountains were crashing down upon us as
the combers fell. I don't know how we happened
to weather it, but once the wind died down, we
saw some distance away a British destroyer, bobbing
about aimlessly on that wild sea. Her decks
had been swept clean, her propellers smashed, her
wireless gone. She was just a plaything of the
waves. We went to her rescue. What was left
of her crew was certainly glad to see us. They
had given up all hope of help coming before Fritz
saw her.</p>

<p>We towed her to her base and on the way we
caught a signal warning us to keep an extra sharp
lookout as a cruiser had been sent to bottom by
a submarine not five miles away. We left the disabled
destroyer at her base and set out for our
own; it was about four in the afternoon. The
storm had died down, but the waves still looked
wicked and the sky was a dirty gray.</p>

<p>Fritz was laying for us. I suppose he had seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
us taking the destroyer in and he figured we'd
start for home. I guess he decided to make a good
day's work of it by sinking us before he sat down
to dinner. Trace was lookout, and he sighted a
small periscope some distance off the port bow.
It extended about a foot out of water and was
visible only a few seconds, but say, did he let out
a yell?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>We charged them. Three seconds later we
dropped a depth charge. That's quick work
for you. Hot on her trail we were and no mistake!
Another destroyer speeded up too and followed
the spray that told which way Fritz was
heading. Oh, he was still determined to get one
of us, for he was making straight for a merchant
vessel in the convoy. We dropped another
charge.</p>

<p>At that instant the submarine's conning tower
appeared on the surface between ourselves and
the convoy. Did we pump hell into her from our
stern gun? We did!</p>

<p>Up came the bow of the submarine. She was
down by the stern, but righted herself and seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
to increase her speed. We were after her like a
streak. We fired from our bow gun. That settled
Fritz. For, after the third shot, the crew of the
submarine came on deck and surrendered, by
God! to the U. S. N.!</p>

<p>The whole thing took exactly ten minutes, but
it seemed a lifetime to me!</p>

<p>We approached the submarine to pick up the
prisoners, while the other destroyers kept their
batteries trained on the boat. We weren't taking
any chances, for there's no telling if Fritz, with
his hands up, won't pull a trigger with his toes.</p>

<p>We got a line to the submarine, but in a few
moments she sank. The line was let go and the
U-boat's crew jumped into the water and swam
to our ship. All of them wore life preservers, but
some of the men were exhausted when they reached
the side of our ship, and, as the submarine sank,
several of them were caught by the radio aerial
and carried below the surface before they could
disentangle themselves.</p>

<p>Ten of the men were so weak that we had to
pass lines under their arms to haul them aboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
and one chap was in such a condition that he could
not hold a line thrown him. I saw him reach for it
and let it slip through his fingers. I couldn't stand
it. I climbed the rail, and, before they could stop
me, I dived in. Someone dived after me. It was
Trace. He felt like I did seeing a man drown before
your eyes. More credit was due him, though,
by a long sight, than me, for his job was coxswain
while I was in a corps that was supposed to save
life. Fine corps man I'd have made if, at my first
chance to rescue a fellow, I'd stood by and let him
go down!</p>

<p>We were hauled aboard with the German between
us. I've never been so cold in my life. I
bet you could hear my teeth chatter clear across
the Atlantic. As for the German, he died in a few
minutes' time. The reason is plain. I wasn't able
to give him first aid, being all in myself. I know
I could have pulled him through. Those other
chaps were no good at resuscitation.</p>

<p>We had four German officers and a crew of
thirty-five prisoners. The first lot taken in this
war by an American destroyer.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>We fed up Fritz on hot coffee and sandwiches.
Our method of handling prisoners is a bit different
from the Huns. They were a pretty seedy lot, but
once we had shelled out warm coats and heavy
clothing to them, they perked up a bit and before
long the crew began to sing. I listened to them,
but somehow it made me sick. I had heard how
they treat our men when they catch them&mdash;they
don't get much chance to sing!</p>

<p>The German officers told us that the first depth
charge had wrecked Fritz's machinery and caused
him to sink to a considerable depth. If we did say
so ourselves, we were pretty good shots!</p>

<p>There wasn't a mark on the submarine that
gave her away, but the lifebelts did. We got her
number. We proceeded to port and there turned
our prisoners over under guard. We felt pretty
cocky over it. Or rather the crew did who had
had a real hand in capturing the Germans. I
hadn't done anything. Why they mentioned me in
the reports I don't know. I guess they didn't remember
about a corps-man's job including the saving
of life&mdash;I did, though. I told you I had studied
hard!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>



<h2>FIREMAN SEYMOUR<br />
SPEAKS:</h2>

<h2>FRITZ GETS TAGGED</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I belong</span> to the Black Gang. You don't hear
much about us because our work keeps us below
deck, and it's good hard work when you're making
twenty knots&mdash;but I like it. I wouldn't change
places with any gun's crew on earth, although they
have more of a chance for their life if trouble
comes. We have duties to perform right in our
quarters in case a ship is struck that keeps us close
to the engines&mdash;there's always danger there&mdash;especially
aboard a coal-burning destroyer&mdash;and
that's what I shipped on.</p>

<p>There wasn't any keeping me out of the navy.
We have four honorable discharges hung up in
our house. I used to show them to my kid. He's
five, but awful smart. He knows all about them.</p>

<p>"That's from the War of 1776," he'll say,
pointing to the first one.</p>

<p>"And that's from the Civil War, my great
Grandpa fought in that."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The third one is for the Spanish-American.</p>

<p>"My grandpa fought in that one," he tells you.</p>

<p>And pretty soon, when this scrap is over there'll
be a fourth one hanging alongside of the others
and Bill can look at it and say, "My pop got that
one in the biggest war of all."</p>

<p>I only wish the youngster was old enough to enlist
himself. We're a fighting family. I joined
the navy in 1915. I was on a battleship then, but
when war broke they transferred me to a destroyer.
We didn't go out until the cold weather
had set in. All of us were given Arctic outfits and
it's lucky we were&mdash;we needed them, believe me!
You are mighty grateful for the heavy woollen
pants and the jumper with a hood that covers your
ears.</p>

<p>Destroyer duty is the most exciting of all, for,
while merchant crafts go out of their way to avoid
submarines, our game is to go out of our way to
hunt them. It was like a game of hide and seek,
with a destroyer "It," trying to tag Fritz if he'd
only give us half a chance.</p>

<p>One of Fritz's pet stunts was to send us an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
S.O.S., giving us the exact location at sea of a
vessel in trouble&mdash;oh, he was awful careful to see
that you got it right, all you needed to do was to
steam up to that spot and be blown clear out of
creation.</p>

<p>Of course, all the calls for help weren't false.
One day we came close enough to see a cargo ship
in flames, and her crew being ordered over her side
to open boats. "Burn the cargo and sink the
ship," was Fritz's creed and if you think that being
set afloat in a life-boat in December is an experience
you'll forget in a hurry, you're wrong!</p>

<p>By the time we reached the survivors, half of
them were dead&mdash;frozen where they sat, their
bodies covered with ice.</p>

<p>We were on duty every minute of the day and
night. I don't think any of the crew slept soundly
for the seven months that we stayed at sea without
ever touching shore. Think of it, seven
months on a ship that's never still, zig-zagging,
doubling on its own course&mdash;charging any floating
objects in hopes of downing a Fritz.</p>

<p>My, but the troopships were glad to see us when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
we went out to meet them. We'd shoot up alongside
of them, or cut clean across their bow, playing
in front of them like a porpoise, as we asked them
what sort of a trip they had had across and how
things were going back home. We'd come so
close to the convoy at times that they could almost
reach out and touch us, then we'd dart away at the
drop of a hat.</p>

<p>As Christmas came near, we hoped to touch
port. We had been promised a Christmas ashore,
but it seemed we had sudden orders to go out and
pick up a convoy, so we headed for the open sea
again.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 439px;">
<img src="images/z255.jpg" width="439" height="595" alt="Marine poster" />
</div>

<p>Christmas Eve was biting cold. I went up for
air and I was glad to hurry back to the engine
room again. It was at least warm down there.
The men who stood watch on deck were muffled to
the eyes. I thought of my wife and the kid. I
wondered if he was hanging up his little stocking
and saying a prayer for his dad who was at sea.
I hadn't heard a word from them, of course, since
I had left home. But on that particular night they
seemed very close to me. I could almost see our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
little sitting room, with a holly wreath in the window.
I remembered just the corner where we always
put up the Christmas tree and I thought of
the fun we had trimming it and trying not to make
a breath of noise to wake the kid. All
this while I realized dimly that the boat was
pitching harder than ever and my mate broke
in with:</p>

<p>"We're in for a gale to celebrate Christmas
proper."</p>

<p>We were, all right! They say it was the worst
storm that had been seen off that coast in many a
year. It was the highest sea I've ever been on.
You could scarcely keep your feet, and as for food&mdash;our
Christmas dinner consisted of hard tack and
lucky we were to get that. You couldn't keep a
thing on the ranges except the stationary kettles.
They managed to make something that was supposed
to be coffee in those and for twenty-two
hours that was our chow.</p>

<p>There were moments through that long night
when I thought we'd turn clean over. We never
expected the rudder to hold with those giant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
waves breaking over the deck and turning everything
to ice.</p>

<p>All the submarines afloat didn't give me the
feeling of nearness to death that that storm had.
I certainly was glad when the sea quieted down
and the sun struggled through the clouds
again.</p>

<p>Up to the first of the year we had not had a
chance to get a shot at Fritz. He had been a bit
too wily for us, getting in his dirty work before
we arrived on the spot, leaving a trail of burning
or sinking ships but no sign of himself. But we
got our revenge. It was in January. We had met
a string of troop and cargo ships from the States,
which we were escorting to port. We were so
near the coast that I guess most of the boys aboard
were getting their things together preparatory to
landing.</p>

<p>It was eight o'clock in the morning and I don't
suppose any of us really dreamed of a submarine
turning up so close to shore, when suddenly the
shrill whistle from a transport made the air
around it blue with its noise! A second later came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
the roar of guns and I knew sure enough that some
tin fish had welcomed us!</p>

<p>I stood by in the engine room, which was my
place in time of danger, listening with all my ears
to the boom of our own guns. Oh, we were after
Fritz all right!</p>

<p>The rumor drifted in to us that there were ten
periscopes to be seen, but soon it came down to
three. The guns from all the ships thundered&mdash;it
was as if a battlefield were transported to the
Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>The roar of guns deafened you, but you certainly
got a thrill you never forgot. We worked
like fiends. We knew they needed speed as never
before. We were like cats after a mouse.</p>

<p>Someone sent up a shout and word came that
oil had begun to show on the water&mdash;that meant
one less submarine afloat! Again the roar of
guns&mdash;again the shout! Two Fritzes sunk.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;!</p>

<p>In the midst of the firing came a strange new
sound&mdash;a buzzing overhead. French airships to
the rescue! They were not more than two hundred
yards above us, dropping bombs as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
flew. I listened for the sound of cheering&mdash;it
came! A third Fritz sunk. In port the sinking
was officially verified&mdash;three German submarines
destroyed, read the record. Not bad, eh?</p>

<p>I don't believe a gun on any of the transports
or destroyers was cold for fully two hours. When
it was over, I went on deck for a breath of air.
I was sweating like a horse and shaking all over
from the strain. The instant I stepped on deck,
Fritz got a shot at us, splintering our deck and
taking one of my fingers along as a souvenir.</p>

<p>Now I ask you, wasn't that rum luck? If I'd
only stayed below where I belonged, I'd still be
plus a finger. The ship's doctor finished up the
job, but I couldn't use that hand, and, believe me,
it made me sore as anything. I knew I'd miss all
the sport going by having to be sent home. I tried
to argue with him. But he wouldn't listen to me&mdash;home
I must go. There wasn't any two ways
about it&mdash;orders is orders.</p>

<p>I traveled back on a transport. I was all right.
My hand was healing fine. I wanted to stand
watch on the way across, but they wouldn't let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
me. Treated me like a blooming invalid and gave
me a month's liberty to get well. Well! I was
well ten minutes after it happened.</p>

<p>No, I didn't tell my wife how I lost it. I said
I'd been mixed up in an accident in the engine
room. That was pretty near the truth. You can
slip so easily with the ship pitching and rearing
that it isn't hard to lose an arm that way. Oh,
if I was to tell her that a sub carried part of my
hand away, she'd worry to death about having
me go to sea again. I'll break it to her after the
war. Just now there's one thing on my mind&mdash;just
one&mdash;to get back somehow in the Black Gang.
I can handle a shovel&mdash;my arm's a bit stiff yet, but
I'm all muscle. Believe me, they aren't going to
shelve me just because one finger's gone! Not by
a long sight!</p>

<p>I'm not going to miss one minute of this scrap
if I can help it. My kid's going to be proud of
my record before I get through&mdash;wait and see if
he isn't!</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a><br /><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE FLOWER OF FRANCE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Ever</span> see those red poppies that grow by the
roadside in France? They always make me think
of Angele. They are so graceful and vivid and
gay. It almost seems as though they enjoyed
watching the soldiers march past, they spring up
so close to the road. All the war that has swept
through the land has failed to kill the crop.
You will find innumerable scarlet patches of
them nodding their brave little heads to the
boys as they tramp by&mdash;cheering them on&mdash;for all
the world like France's daughters&mdash;bless them!</p>

<p>I was one of the first Americans to go across
after our declaration of war on Germany. Those
were the days when the German propagandists in
this country knew more about the movements of
our fleet than we did ourselves.</p>

<p>They called upon us formally a way off the
French coast, with two torpedoes. But they were
bad shots, so their visiting cards never arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and we continued our course without any further
opportunity of making their acquaintance.</p>

<p>As we neared the coast the water became clotted
up with wreckage&mdash;boxes and barrels and floating
planks&mdash;yes&mdash;and bodies, too. I've never seen a
sight to equal it and I have crossed eight times all
told. But in the beginning of the war Fritz was
pretty active. Never a day passed that we received
less than seven or eight S.O.S. calls. Oh,
Fritz was having it all his own way then. We've
changed all that&mdash;rather!</p>

<p>I'll never forget the little French port where
we dropped anchor. Nothing I can ever see in the
years to come&mdash;with the exception of the Allied
flags floating over the Kaiser's palace in Berlin&mdash;will
equal the thrill I got from watching the first
khaki-clad Yankees marching up that narrow
street to the tune of Yankee Doodle!</p>

<p>I kept wondering who the dickens I was, to be
privileged to witness such a history-making sight!</p>

<p>The townsfolk mobbed us. They cheered us and
hugged us and called down blessings on our heads.
Someone took pity on us and showed us the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
to an inn&mdash;a rambling white shallet with a big
American flag hung from its windows. At the
gate, the innkeeper and his plump little wife were
awaiting us with open arms. They asked us if we
would consent to eat "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poullet</i>." Consent! We
would have devoured birch bark with a relish had
it been cooked the way Madame Mousequet could
cook!</p>

<p>I have never tasted such chicken or such potatoes.
And while we ate and drank the little lady
fluttered about us, hoping, in voluble French, that
everything suited "the dear officers from the
United States."</p>

<p>They would not take a cent of pay for the feast.
It was, they assured us, "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une grande honneur</i>."
Over and over they insisted that we must not think
of spoiling their pleasure by having money pass
between us. What can you do with people like
that?</p>

<p>That night we went to a little cinema theater.
When the lights were turned up and the audience
caught sight of us, they rose in a body and cheered
us. In one of the boxes were a group of French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
officers and their wives. One of the officers hurried
around to where we were sitting.</p>

<p>"You must place yourself where all the people
may see you," he insisted. There was no refusing
him. He was like a child, bubbling over with joy
at having us there.</p>

<p>"Come," he pleaded, "let me seat you so that
all may see."</p>

<p>We followed meekly. The ladies in the box
were awaiting us eagerly. They welcomed us with
outstretched hands. And as I looked at those
people who had been through two grilling years
of war, I thanked God I came from a country that
had taken up arms against a beast who was trying
to crush the red poppies beneath his heel.</p>

<p>It was hard to get leave to go up to Paris. Sailings
were uncertain and special permission had to
be obtained, but I made up my mind I'd go. General
Pershing was to be there for the Fourth of
July celebration at the tomb of Lafayette. I knew
that would be a never-to-be-forgotten sight.</p>

<p>I was right. It was a glorious morning and the
thrill of the day was in the air&mdash;crowds everywhere&mdash;sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
blue and navy blue uniforms rubbing
shoulders with the khaki of our own boys.
Women, many of them in black, hurrying&mdash;hurrying
toward the spot where the great Commander-in-Chief
of the American Expeditionary Forces
could be seen.</p>

<p>"Pershing!" Everywhere you heard his name
and an under-current of eager whispers as to
whether there would be a chance to see him or not.</p>

<p>The Fourth of July! Paris! And our General,
the idol of the hour! I tell you it thrilled me clear
down to my heels!</p>

<p>We navy men were let through the crowd and
we were able to view the ceremony at close range.
I have never heard such cheering in my life! It
was Paris' first opportunity to hear our General
speak, and he spoke so simply&mdash;so quietly&mdash;in the
face of that great ovation that there was not one
among us who could doubt his ability to lead our
men as they had never before been led.</p>

<p>There were to be fireworks that night in honor
of our presence&mdash;concerts and speeches and dancing.
Oh, France was showing us that she was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
we had come, but how glad we were to be there she
can never guess!</p>

<p>I drifted idly with the crowd. I wandered down
to the big station&mdash;the <i>Gare de Lyons</i>. What took
me there I scarcely know. Fate, I suppose, because
there were a thousand and one places I
might have gone instead.</p>

<p>The station was full of a bustling mob&mdash;uniforms&mdash;uniforms
everywhere. A train load of
soldiers had just arrived on leave from the Front.
That was a sight for you, as their eager eyes
lighted on some loved one's face! I tell you, it
kept your heart jumping in your throat to see
them. Some of them were so white and worn and
haggard. Most of them bronzed and wiry, a bit
grimy from the long train trip, with uniforms
faded and sometimes torn. But weariness and
dirt and tears could not hide the spirit that shone
in their eyes as they clasped their wife and little
ones to them.</p>

<p>A young artillery officer came toward me. He
was a handsome man with a bit of a swagger in
spite of his limp. I saw his eyes roving the crowd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
restlessly in search of someone. Suddenly he
caught sight of me.</p>

<p>"Ah! An American! What joy! <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive
L'Amerique!</i>" he shouted.</p>

<p>I thanked him. I told him my name and he told
me his. It was Louis du Frere, and he lived at
Faubourg St. Germain. He was just back from
the trenches on a precious leave of seven days.
Wounded? He shrugged. But, yes, fifteen times
so far, and what of that?</p>

<p>I stared at him. Wounded fifteen times and yet
eager to go back! Spirit of France, you are indomitable!</p>

<p>He excused himself as he scanned the crowd.
His sister was to meet him. She was there somewhere.
She never failed him. Ah, yes! He had
found her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>I turned to see a little black-clad figure rush
into his arms and cling to him as though she could
never let him go. He spoke to her gently.</p>

<p>"Angele," he said, "this gentleman is a great
officer of the American navy. Tell him how glad
you are to welcome him to France."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>At that she whirled and since then I have never
been able to see a red poppy without thinking of
her. I don't remember what I said in my very
limited French, but her brother broke in to explain
that she had lost her young husband at the battle
of the Marne and he ended up by announcing to
her that I was going to spend the rest of my liberty
as their guest.</p>

<p>I tried to protest, to insist that I had no intention
of thrusting my presence upon them for
eleven days. But he took my refusal with the air
of a hurt child and when Angele joined her pleas
with his, I succumbed. I let du Frere hail a cab
and we all piled in. I gathered up my few possessions
at the hotel and climbed aboard again,
and we rumbled through the streets of Paris toward
St. Germain, Angele clinging to her brother's
arm and listening with a wrapt look on her
face to his gay comments on trench life.</p>

<p>I thought I must be dreaming it all. It was so
like the scene of a play&mdash;Paris slipping away from
us, as we rattled across a long bridge, the open
country becoming greener and leafier every instant&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
gay voice of the young officer, the eager
questions of our little old driver, and the poppy-like
girl, with lips parted, drinking in breathlessly
every word her brother uttered.</p>

<p>We stopped before a tiny house, shaded by tall
trees. I saw, gathered before it, a little knot of
people, shading their eyes for a glimpse of the
returning hero.</p>

<p>They pounced upon him, men, women, and
children&mdash;all his neighbors, who had awaited his
home coming for heaven only knows how many
hours. They shouted their welcome to him, each
of them clasping him for a minute and claiming
his full attention.</p>

<p>Angele stood looking on, the tears rolling down
her cheeks, even while her lips smiled.</p>

<p>"They love him so," she said softly, as though
to explain it, "he is so brave!"</p>

<p>I think he was, to face that mob.</p>

<p>They followed him in. The table was spread
with every sort of delicacy. Each one of them
had contributed something choice&mdash;some dish of
which he was especially fond. He exclaimed over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
it all rapturously. He left nothing to be desired in
his eager enthusiasm.</p>

<p>They gave him no time to rest. They poured a
torrent of questions upon him. Questions about
their own brothers and husbands and lovers&mdash;questions
concerning warfare&mdash;trench life&mdash;battles
in which he had fought. And he told them all
he knew until at length Angele scolded them
tenderly and bore him off. Then it was that they
turned upon me as the second best object of interest.</p>

<p>Never in a lifetime could I answer all that they
asked of me. What did our country hope to do?
How many men could she send across at
once? How long did she think the war would
last?</p>

<p>I tell you I was glad to see Angele and Louis
reappear and to follow them to the feast. I was
placed at Angele's right hand&mdash;the guest of honor&mdash;I
sat down with a sigh of relief as I saw the
tempting spread. Sat down! We were never
down more than an instant before someone would
leap up and propose a standing toast to Pershing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and to Joffre, to President Wilson and to President
Poincair&eacute;, to myself, to my navy, to my country!</p>

<p>And the Marseillaise! How they did sing that!
three and four times, shouting the chorus until
the rafters shook!</p>

<p>Then Louis pounded on the table for order.</p>

<p>"The American officer will now sing his National
Anthem," he announced.</p>

<p>There was instant silence, then encouraging applause,
then silence.</p>

<p>"But yes, you will sing it," urged Angele, seeing
my panic.</p>

<p>Now, in the first place, I cannot carry a tune
and in the second place I knew just one verse of
the "Star Spangled Banner"&mdash;and I was not over
sure of that one!</p>

<p>I have never felt a shame equal to mine as I
struggled desperately through the first verse of
my country's song! They applauded madly. I
might have been Caruso to judge from the racket
they made.</p>

<p>But Louis was not satisfied.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Permit me also to sing it for you," he said,
and sing it he did&mdash;all three verses of it,&mdash;with a
ring to his voice that thrilled me and held me
spellbound. I asked him where he had learned it.
It seems, he modestly explained, an American ambulance
driver had employed his time in the
trenches teaching it to him.</p>

<p>After supper we danced to the music of a string
band. But Louis sat in a corner, surrounded by a
group of older men and I could see they were in
earnest, thrashing out the latest developments at
the Front. That gave me a chance with Angele&mdash;or
rather&mdash;half a chance, because her every
thought was with her brother.</p>

<p>"He is all the world to me," she said.</p>

<p>She watched over him in spite of himself and
when she concluded he must be tired, she whispered
it to his friends and they began, one by
one, to leave, in spite of his protests. He went
with them to the door, shouting, waving, kissing
his hand. When he came back to us he did look
a bit done up.</p>

<p>"Ah, Angele, it is good to be at home," he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
and then, as though fearing that might seem a confession
of weakness, he hastened to add, "for a
little time!"</p>

<p>We spent six wonderfully lazy days in the heart
of summer. It was there that I came to know the
poppies which were so like Angele, so radiant, so
graceful&mdash;so lovely. I told her once that she put
me in mind of them.</p>

<p>"I am glad," she replied, "because I, too, love
them."</p>

<p>My leave was not up for eleven days all told,
and Louis had persuaded me to stay on at the little
cottage after his return to duty. I did not need
much persuading. It seemed as though I could
never tear myself away from that tiny house
shaded by tall trees.</p>

<p>The night before he left I don't think any of us
slept a wink. The neighbors arrived, laden with
all sorts of dainties&mdash;cakes and bread they had
made for him to take back. They brought packages
for their own boys, too, that he cheerfully
promised to distribute. They gave him letters
and a thousand messages, which he repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
painstakingly after them. He was so gentle with
them, so eager to do as they asked.</p>

<p>He was particularly pleased over a little bunch
of wild flowers a tiny girl had gathered for him,
the flowers were drooping and faded from being
clasped in her hot little hand, but he told her again
and again how much he loved them, until her little
cheeks glowed pink with joy and her eyes shone
like stars.</p>

<p>After they had gone, I stole away and left Angele
alone with him. They sat in the open doorway,
her cheek against his arm, her hand in his.
She was not sad, there was a happy, busy note in
her voice as she chatted to him.</p>

<p>Before he climbed the stairs to bed, he sought
me. I was smoking and thinking, on a little bench
beneath the trees. Louis sat beside me and laid
his hand on my knee.</p>

<p>"Well, my friend, I leave before you. For a
little while we part, is it not so?&mdash;then, God willing,
we meet again."</p>

<p>I tried to tell him what my visit had meant to
me. What a place France and her people would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
for ever more occupy in my heart. All those
things I struggled to say, but when it comes to
expressing that which lies close to our heart, I find
we are a halting, tongue-tied nation!</p>

<p>Then I spoke of Angele. I wanted him to know
before he left how much I cared for her. I was
afraid he might be displeased, but, instead, he
pumped my hand with joy.</p>

<p>"This is American fashion," he laughed, then
he leaned over and kissed my cheek. "Since you
love a French girl you will have to get used to her
brother's greeting," he said.</p>

<p>I told him I had not spoken to Angele. I had
not dared to. I could not hope she would care
for me.</p>

<p>"But you must speak to-night, before I go," he
shouted. "Let me prepare her first. Oh, but this
is of a great happiness to me!"</p>

<p>And before I could stop him, he hurried away.</p>

<p>After a long silence, while my heart thumped
against my ribs and I felt myself growing hot and
cold by turns, his voice sounded through the darkness.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come here, my friend, and see what you can
do to make this child change her mind."</p>

<p>I ran toward him. I saw the flash of Angele's
white gown, but when I reached her side, Louis
had gone. She awaited me. Somehow she looked
like the poppies at twilight, when their petals are
folded.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>We were there together so long, that at length
Louis' voice broke in upon us and startled us.
He shouted that he must leave in six hours&mdash;that
a brother returning to the Front had some claim
upon his sister's time. Angele flew to his side,
begging him to forgive her selfishness, but he
pinched her cheek and laughed at her, brimming
over with happiness at the romance for which he
claimed he was responsible.</p>

<p>"But you must not take her away until after
the war," he pleaded. "I want her here to greet
me when I come home. I am a selfish brute, I
know, but I would have nothing to return to if my
little sister were gone."</p>

<p>I promised him. I would have promised anything
that night I was so happy. It did not seem,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
as I stood in that quiet, leafy garden, with Angele's
hand in mine, that there could be pain and
anguish in the world&mdash;that cannons could be roaring
and star shells bursting less than a hundred
miles away!</p>

<p>Louis left at daybreak. We drove to Paris with
him and to the station. It was a gay morning with
a red sun rolling up from the east.</p>

<p>Angele was all smiles and animation, full of
eager plans for his next leave. She submitted to
his teasing with a laugh, but, for all that, her eyes
looked as though they held a world of unshed
tears, and I saw her, once or twice, press her lips
together as though to choke back the sobs.</p>

<p>The station was full of men returning to the
Front. They called eagerly to one another&mdash;they
compared packages, and boasted of the good times
they had had. Louis caught my hand and wrung
it. Then he laid Angele's in it.</p>

<p>"She is all I have," he said; "it is fitting I leave
her in the care of our beloved ally."</p>

<p>He kissed her and teased her about capturing an
American in seven days, saluted us smartly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
stalked through the great gate, turning to wave
and smile and kiss his hand.</p>

<p>I never felt such a sense of loss in my life. It
seemed as though the sun had gone out of the day.</p>

<p>"I cannot bear it," Angele whispered, so I took
her away.</p>

<p>We spent the few remaining days of my leave
planning our life after the war. She will not
marry me until then. She and Louis are coming
to the States to live and we three are to be as
happy as the days are long. We will be, too. I
know it.</p>

<p>I have been across seven times since and I have
seen her four of those times in the past year. If
there is any man on earth who wants this war to
end it is I&mdash;and the reason is a certain flower-like
girl in France. Good Lord! you don't know what
waiting for her means!</p>

<p>We've got to finish those Germans quickly and
thoroughly so that Louis and Angele and I can
set sail for America. If that is not a reason for
ending this war, find me a better one!</p>

in his style which insures keenest interest on the
part of the reader.</p>

<br />
<span class='bit'>By DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS</span><br />
<br />
<i>The Man Who Set the World to Laughing&mdash;and<br />
Kept Himself Happy and Well.</i></div>


<p>Many are the inspirational books that now
abound written around the various phases of
existence, but "Laugh and Live" is a thing apart
from any other. Perhaps it is the author's style
of writing, sort of "hammer and tongs," breezy,
convincing, seeming to come out of real experience.
But the remarkable quality of the book is
that it fascinates the mind the same as a high-class
novel&mdash;grips one's faculties from chapter to
chapter. There is no preaching, no "Fatherliness,"
no "Big I" and "Little You" in the text.
It is more like the talk of a widely experienced
comrade back from a voyage. Asked to tell what
he saw in his travels he proceeds to do it
modestly and well.</p>
